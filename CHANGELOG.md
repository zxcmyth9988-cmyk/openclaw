### Changes

### Breaking

### Fixes
- Security/Skills: escape user-controlled prompt, filename, and output-path values in `openai-image-gen` HTML gallery generation to prevent stored XSS in generated `index.html` output. (#12538) Thanks @CornBrother0x.
- Security/OTEL: redact sensitive values (API keys, tokens, credential fields) from diagnostics-otel log bodies, log attributes, and error/reason span fields before OTLP export. (#12542) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Providers/OpenRouter: remove conflicting top-level `reasoning_effort` when injecting nested `reasoning.effort`, preventing OpenRouter 400 payload-validation failures for reasoning models. (#24120) thanks @tenequm.

## 2026.2.23

### Changes

- Control UI/Agents: make the Tools panel data-driven from runtime `tools.catalog`, add per-tool provenance labels (`core` / `plugin:<id>` + optional marker), and keep a static fallback list when the runtime catalog is unavailable.
- Control UI/Cron: add full web cron edit parity (including clone and richer validation/help text), plus all-jobs run history with pagination/search/sort/multi-filter controls and improved cron page layout for cleaner scheduling and failure triage workflows.
- Provider/Mistral: add support for the Mistral provider, including memory embeddings and voice support. (#23845) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Update/Core: add an optional built-in auto-updater for package installs (`update.auto.*`), default-off, with stable rollout delay+jitter and beta hourly cadence.
- CLI/Update: add `openclaw update --dry-run` to preview channel/tag/target/restart actions without mutating config, installing, syncing plugins, or restarting.
- Config/UI: add tag-aware settings filtering and broaden config labels/help copy so fields are easier to discover and understand in the dashboard config screen.
- Channels/Synology Chat: add a native Synology Chat channel plugin with webhook ingress, direct-message routing, outbound send/media support, per-account config, and DM policy controls. (#23012)
- iOS/Talk: prefetch TTS segments and suppress expected speech-cancellation errors for smoother talk playback. (#22833) Thanks @ngutman.
- Memory/FTS: add Spanish and Portuguese stop-word filtering for query expansion in FTS-only search mode, improving conversational recall for both languages. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Memory/FTS: add Japanese-aware query expansion tokenization and stop-word filtering (including mixed-script terms like ASCII + katakana) for FTS-only search mode. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Memory/FTS: add Korean stop-word filtering and particle-aware keyword extraction (including mixed Korean/English stems) for query expansion in FTS-only search mode. (#18899) Thanks @ruypang.
- Memory/FTS: add Arabic stop-word filtering for query expansion in FTS-only search mode to reduce conversational filler in Arabic memory searches. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Discord/Allowlist: canonicalize resolved Discord allowlist names to IDs and split resolution flow for clearer fail-closed behavior.
- Channels/Config: unify channel preview streaming config handling with a shared resolver and canonical migration path.
- Gateway/Auth: unify call/probe/status/auth credential-source precedence on shared resolver helpers, with table-driven parity coverage across gateway entrypoints.
- Gateway/Auth: refactor gateway credential resolution and websocket auth handshake paths to use shared typed auth contexts, including explicit `auth.deviceToken` support in connect frames and tests.
- Skills: remove bundled `food-order` skill from this repo; manage/install it from ClawHub instead.
- Docs/Subagents: make thread-bound session guidance channel-first instead of Discord-specific, and list thread-supporting channels explicitly. (#23589) Thanks @osolmaz.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** removed Google Antigravity provider support and the bundled `google-antigravity-auth` plugin. Existing `google-antigravity/*` model/profile configs no longer work; migrate to `google-gemini-cli` or other supported providers.
- **BREAKING:** tool-failure replies now hide raw error details by default. OpenClaw still sends a failure summary, but detailed error suffixes (for example provider/runtime messages and local path fragments) now require `/verbose on` or `/verbose full`.
- **BREAKING:** CLI local onboarding now sets `session.dmScope` to `per-channel-peer` by default for new/implicit DM scope configuration. If you depend on shared DM continuity across senders, explicitly set `session.dmScope` to `main`. (#23468) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- **BREAKING:** unify channel preview-streaming config to `channels.<channel>.streaming` with enum values `off | partial | block | progress`, and move Slack native stream toggle to `channels.slack.nativeStreaming`. Legacy keys (`streamMode`, Slack boolean `streaming`) are still read and migrated by `openclaw doctor --fix`, but canonical saved config/docs now use the unified names.
- **BREAKING:** remove legacy Gateway device-auth signature `v1`. Device-auth clients must now sign `v2` payloads with the per-connection `connect.challenge` nonce and send `device.nonce`; nonce-less connects are rejected.

### Fixes

- Agents/Compaction: count auto-compactions only after a non-retry `auto_compaction_end`, keeping session `compactionCount` aligned to completed compactions.
- Security/CLI: redact sensitive values in `openclaw config get` output before printing config paths, preventing credential leakage to terminal output/history. (#13683) Thanks @SleuthCo.
- Install/Discord Voice: make `@discordjs/opus` an optional dependency so `openclaw` install/update no longer hard-fails when native Opus builds fail, while keeping `opusscript` as the runtime fallback decoder for Discord voice flows. (#23737, #23733, #23703) Thanks @jeadland, @Sheetaa, and @Breakyman.
- Docker/Setup: precreate `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR/identity` during `docker-setup.sh` so CLI commands that need device identity (for example `devices list`) avoid `EACCES ... /home/node/.openclaw/identity` failures on restrictive bind mounts. (#23948) Thanks @ackson-beep.
- Exec/Background: stop applying the default exec timeout to background sessions (`background: true` or explicit `yieldMs`) when no explicit timeout is set, so long-running background jobs are no longer terminated at the default timeout boundary. (#23303)
- Slack/Threading: sessions: keep parent-session forking and thread-history context active beyond first turn by removing first-turn-only gates in session init, thread-history fetch, and reply prompt context injection. (#23843, #23090) Thanks @vincentkoc and @Taskle.
- Slack/Threading: respect `replyToMode` when Slack auto-populates top-level `thread_ts`, and ignore inline `replyToId` directive tags when `replyToMode` is `off` so thread forcing stays disabled unless explicitly configured. (#23839, #23320, #23513) Thanks @vincentkoc and @dorukardahan.
- Slack/Extension: forward `message read` `threadId` to `readMessages` and use delivery-context `threadId` as outbound `thread_ts` fallback so extension replies/reads stay in the correct Slack thread. (#22216, #22485, #23836) Thanks @vincentkoc, @lan17 and @dorukardahan.
- Slack/Upload: resolve bare user IDs (U-prefix) to DM channel IDs via `conversations.open` before calling `files.uploadV2`, which rejects non-channel IDs. `chat.postMessage` tolerates user IDs directly, but `files.uploadV2` → `completeUploadExternal` validates `channel_id` against `^[CGDZ][A-Z0-9]{8,}$`, causing `invalid_arguments` when agents reply with media to DM conversations.
- Webchat/Chat: apply assistant `final` payload messages directly to chat state so sent turns render without waiting for a full history refresh cycle. (#14928) Thanks @BradGroux.
- Webchat/Chat: for out-of-band final events (for example tool-call side runs), append provided final assistant payloads directly instead of forcing a transient history reset. (#11139) Thanks @AkshayNavle.
- Webchat/Performance: reload `chat.history` after final events only when the final payload lacks a renderable assistant message, avoiding expensive full-history refreshes on normal turns. (#20588) Thanks @amzzzzzzz.
- Webchat/Sessions: preserve external session routing metadata when internal `chat.send` turns run under `webchat`, so explicit channel-keyed sessions (for example Telegram) no longer get rewritten to `webchat` and misroute follow-up delivery. (#23258) Thanks @binary64.
- Webchat/Sessions: preserve existing session `label` across `/new` and `/reset` rollovers so reset sessions remain discoverable in session history lists. (#23755) Thanks @ThunderStormer.
- Gateway/Chat UI: strip inline reply/audio directive tags from non-streaming final webchat broadcasts (including `chat.inject`) while preserving empty-string message content when tags are the entire reply. (#23298) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Chat/UI: strip inline reply/audio directive tags (`[[reply_to_current]]`, `[[reply_to:<id>]]`, `[[audio_as_voice]]`) from displayed chat history, live chat event output, and session preview snippets so control tags no longer leak into user-visible surfaces.
- Gateway/Chat UI: sanitize non-streaming final `chat.send`/`chat.inject` payload text with the same envelope/untrusted-context stripping used by `chat.history`, preventing `<<<EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT...>>>` wrapper markup from rendering in Control UI chat. (#24012) Thanks @mittelaltergouda.
- Telegram/Media: send a user-facing Telegram reply when media download fails (non-size errors) instead of silently dropping the message.
- Telegram/Webhook: keep webhook monitors alive until gateway abort signals fire, preventing false channel exits and immediate webhook auto-restart loops.
- Telegram/Polling: retry recoverable setup-time network failures in monitor startup and await runner teardown before retry to avoid overlapping polling sessions.
- Telegram/Polling: clear Telegram webhooks (`deleteWebhook`) before starting long-poll `getUpdates`, including retry handling for transient cleanup failures.
- Telegram/Webhook: add `channels.telegram.webhookPort` config support and pass it through plugin startup wiring to the monitor listener.
- Browser/Extension Relay: refactor the MV3 worker to preserve debugger attachments across relay drops, auto-reconnect with bounded backoff+jitter, persist and rehydrate attached tab state via `chrome.storage.session`, recover from `target_closed` navigation detaches, guard stale socket handlers, enforce per-tab operation locks and per-request timeouts, and add lifecycle keepalive/badge refresh hooks (`alarms`, `webNavigation`). (#15099, #6175, #8468, #9807)
- Browser/Relay: treat extension websocket as connected only when `OPEN`, allow reconnect when a stale `CLOSING/CLOSED` extension socket lingers, and guard stale socket message/close handlers so late events cannot clear active relay state; includes regression coverage for live-duplicate `409` rejection and immediate reconnect-after-close races. (#15099, #18698, #20688)
- Browser/Remote CDP: extend stale-target recovery so `ensureTabAvailable()` now reuses the sole available tab for remote CDP profiles (same behavior as extension profiles) while preserving strict `tab not found` errors when multiple tabs exist; includes remote-profile regression tests. (#15989)
- Gateway/Pairing: treat `operator.admin` as satisfying other `operator.*` scope checks during device-auth verification so local CLI/TUI sessions stop entering pairing-required loops for pairing/approval-scoped commands. (#22062, #22193, #21191) Thanks @Botaccess, @jhartshorn, and @ctbritt.
- Gateway/Pairing: auto-approve loopback `scope-upgrade` pairing requests (including device-token reconnects) so local clients do not disconnect on pairing-required scope elevation. (#23708) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Gateway/Scopes: include `operator.read` and `operator.write` in default operator connect scope bundles across CLI, Control UI, and macOS clients so write-scoped announce/sub-agent follow-up calls no longer hit `pairing required` disconnects on loopback gateways. (#22582) thanks @YuzuruS.
- Gateway/Pairing: treat operator.admin pairing tokens as satisfying operator.write requests so legacy devices stop looping through scope-upgrade prompts introduced in 2026.2.19. (#23125, #23006) Thanks @vignesh07.
- Gateway/Restart: fix restart-loop edge cases by keeping `openclaw.mjs -> dist/entry.js` bootstrap detection explicit, reacquiring the gateway lock for in-process restart fallback paths, and tightening restart-loop regression coverage. (#23416) Thanks @jeffwnli.
- Gateway/Lock: use optional gateway-port reachability as a primary stale-lock liveness signal (and wire gateway run-loop lock acquisition to the resolved port), reducing false "already running" lockouts after unclean exits. (#23760) Thanks @Operative-001.
- Delivery/Queue: quarantine queue entries immediately on known permanent delivery errors (for example invalid recipients or missing conversation references) by moving them to `failed/` instead of retrying on every restart. (#23794) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Cron/Status: split execution outcome (`lastRunStatus`) from delivery outcome (`lastDeliveryStatus`) in persisted cron state, finished events, and run history so failed/unknown announcement delivery is visible without conflating it with run errors.
- Cron/Delivery: route text-only announce jobs with explicit thread/topic targets through direct outbound delivery so forum/thread destinations do not get dropped by intermediary announce turns. (#23841) Thanks @AndrewArto.
- Cron: honor `cron.maxConcurrentRuns` in the timer loop so due jobs can execute up to the configured parallelism instead of always running serially. (#11595) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Cron/Run: enforce the same per-job timeout guard for manual `cron.run` executions as timer-driven runs, including abort propagation for isolated agent jobs, so forced runs cannot wedge indefinitely. (#23704) Thanks @tkuehnl.
- Cron/Run: persist the manual-run `runningAtMs` marker before releasing the cron lock so overlapping timer ticks cannot start the same job concurrently.
- Cron/Startup: enforce per-job timeout guards for startup catch-up replay runs so missed isolated jobs cannot hang indefinitely during gateway boot recovery.
- Cron/Main session: honor abort/timeout signals while retrying `wakeMode=now` heartbeat contention loops so main-target cron runs stop promptly instead of waiting through the full busy-retry window.
- Cron/Schedule: for `every` jobs, prefer `lastRunAtMs + everyMs` when still in the future after restarts, then fall back to anchor scheduling for catch-up windows, so NEXT timing matches the last successful cadence. (#22895) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Cron/Service: execute manual `cron.run` jobs outside the cron lock (while still persisting started/finished state atomically) so `cron.list` and `cron.status` remain responsive during long forced runs. (#23628) Thanks @dsgraves.
- Cron/Timer: keep a watchdog recheck timer armed while `onTimer` is actively executing so the scheduler continues polling even if a due-run tick stalls for an extended period. (#23628) Thanks @dsgraves.
- Cron/Run log: clean up settled per-path run-log write queue entries so long-running cron uptime does not retain stale promise bookkeeping in memory.
- Cron/Run log: harden `cron.runs` run-log path resolution by rejecting path-separator `id`/`jobId` inputs and enforcing reads within the per-cron `runs/` directory.
- Cron/Announce: when announce delivery target resolution fails (for example multiple configured channels with no explicit target), skip injecting fallback `Cron (error): ...` into the main session so runs fail cleanly without accidental last-route sends. (#24074)
- Cron/Telegram: validate cron `delivery.to` with shared Telegram target parsing and resolve legacy `@username`/`t.me` targets to numeric IDs at send-time for deterministic delivery target writeback. (#21930) Thanks @kesor.
- Telegram/Targets: normalize unprefixed topic-qualified targets through the shared parse/normalize path so valid `@channel:topic:<id>` and `<chatId>:topic:<id>` routes are recognized again. (#24166) Thanks @obviyus.
- Cron/Isolation: force fresh session IDs for isolated cron runs so `sessionTarget="isolated"` executions never reuse prior run context. (#23470) Thanks @echoVic.
- Plugins/Install: strip `workspace:*` devDependency entries from copied plugin manifests before `npm install --omit=dev`, preventing `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` install failures for npm-published channel plugins (including Feishu and MS Teams).
- Feishu/Plugins: restore bundled Feishu SDK availability for global installs and strip `openclaw: workspace:*` from plugin `devDependencies` during plugin-version sync so npm-installed Feishu plugins do not fail dependency install. (#23611, #23645, #23603)
- Config/Channels: auto-enable built-in channels by writing `channels.<id>.enabled=true` (not `plugins.entries.<id>`), and stop adding built-ins to `plugins.allow`, preventing `plugins.entries.telegram: plugin not found` validation failures.
- Config/Channels: when `plugins.allow` is active, auto-enable/enable flows now also allowlist configured built-in channels so `channels.<id>.enabled=true` cannot remain blocked by restrictive plugin allowlists.
- Plugins/Discovery: ignore scanned extension backup/disabled directory patterns (for example `.backup-*`, `.bak`, `.disabled*`) and move updater backup directories under `.openclaw-install-backups`, preventing duplicate plugin-id collisions from archived copies.
- Plugins/CLI: make `openclaw plugins enable` and plugin install/link flows update allowlists via shared plugin-enable policy so enabled plugins are not left disabled by allowlist mismatch. (#23190) Thanks @downwind7clawd-ctrl.
- Security/Voice Call: harden media stream WebSocket handling against pre-auth idle-connection DoS by adding strict pre-start timeouts, pending/per-IP connection limits, and total connection caps for streaming endpoints. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Sessions: redact sensitive token patterns from `sessions_history` tool output and surface `contentRedacted` metadata when masking occurs. (#16928) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Exec: stop trusting `PATH`-derived directories for safe-bin allowlist checks, add explicit `tools.exec.safeBinTrustedDirs`, and pin safe-bin shell execution to resolved absolute executable paths to prevent binary-shadowing approval bypasses. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Elevated: match `tools.elevated.allowFrom` against sender identities only (not recipient `ctx.To`), closing a recipient-token bypass for `/elevated` authorization. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Feishu: enforce ID-only allowlist matching for DM/group sender authorization, normalize Feishu ID prefixes during checks, and ignore mutable display names so display-name collisions cannot satisfy allowlist entries. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Group policy: harden `channels.*.groups.*.toolsBySender` matching by requiring explicit sender-key types (`id:`, `e164:`, `username:`, `name:`), preventing cross-identifier collisions across mutable/display-name fields while keeping legacy untyped keys on a deprecated ID-only path. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Channels/Group policy: fail closed when `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` is set without explicit `groups`, honor account-level `groupPolicy` overrides, and enforce `groupPolicy: "disabled"` as a hard group block. (#22215) Thanks @etereo.
- Telegram/Discord extensions: propagate trusted `mediaLocalRoots` through extension outbound `sendMedia` options so extension direct-send media paths honor agent-scoped local-media allowlists. (#20029, #21903, #23227)
- Agents/Exec: honor explicit agent context when resolving `tools.exec` defaults for runs with opaque/non-agent session keys, so per-agent `host/security/ask` policies are applied consistently. (#11832)
- Doctor/Security: add an explicit warning that `approvals.exec.enabled=false` disables forwarding only, while enforcement remains driven by host-local `exec-approvals.json` policy. (#15047)
- Sandbox/Docker: default sandbox container user to the workspace owner `uid:gid` when `agents.*.sandbox.docker.user` is unset, fixing non-root gateway file-tool permissions under capability-dropped containers. (#20979)
- Plugins/Media sandbox: propagate trusted `mediaLocalRoots` through plugin action dispatch (including Discord/Telegram action adapters) so plugin send paths enforce the same agent-scoped local-media sandbox roots as core outbound sends. (#20258, #22718)
- Agents/Workspace guard: map sandbox container-workdir file-tool paths (for example `/workspace/...` and `file:///workspace/...`) to host workspace roots before workspace-only validation, preventing false `Path escapes sandbox root` rejections for sandbox file tools. (#9560)
- Gateway/Exec approvals: expire approval requests immediately when no approval-capable gateway clients are connected and no forwarding targets are available, avoiding delayed approvals after restarts/offline approver windows. (#22144)
- Security/Exec approvals: when approving wrapper commands with allow-always in allowlist mode, persist inner executable paths for known dispatch wrappers (`env`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `timeout`) and fail closed (no persisted entry) when wrapper unwrapping is not safe, preventing wrapper-path approval bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Node/macOS exec host: default headless macOS node `system.run` to local execution and only route through the companion app when `OPENCLAW_NODE_EXEC_HOST=app` is explicitly set, avoiding companion-app filesystem namespace mismatches during exec. (#23547)
- Sandbox/Media: map container workspace paths (`/workspace/...` and `file:///workspace/...`) back to the host sandbox root for outbound media validation, preventing false deny errors for sandbox-generated local media. (#23083) Thanks @echo931.
- Sandbox/Docker: apply custom bind mounts after workspace mounts and prioritize bind-source resolution on overlapping paths, so explicit workspace binds are no longer ignored. (#22669) Thanks @tasaankaeris.
- Exec approvals/Forwarding: restore Discord text forwarding when component approvals are not configured, and carry request snapshots through resolve events so resolved notices still forward after cache misses/restarts. (#22988) Thanks @bubmiller.
- Control UI/WebSocket: stop and clear the browser gateway client on UI teardown so remounts cannot leave orphan websocket clients that create duplicate active connections. (#23422) Thanks @floatinggball-design.
- Control UI/WebSocket: send a stable per-tab `instanceId` in websocket connect frames so reconnect cycles keep a consistent client identity for diagnostics and presence tracking. (#23616) Thanks @zq58855371-ui.
- Config/Memory: allow `"mistral"` in `agents.defaults.memorySearch.provider` and `agents.defaults.memorySearch.fallback` schema validation. (#14934) Thanks @ThomsenDrake.
- Feishu/Commands: in group chats, command authorization now falls back to top-level `channels.feishu.allowFrom` when per-group `allowFrom` is not set, so `/command` no longer gets blocked by an unintended empty allowlist. (#23756)
- Dev tooling: prevent `CLAUDE.md` symlink target regressions by excluding CLAUDE symlink sentinels from `oxfmt` and marking them `-text` in `.gitattributes`, so formatter/EOL normalization cannot reintroduce trailing-newline targets. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Compaction: restore embedded compaction safeguard/context-pruning extension loading in production by wiring bundled extension factories into the resource loader instead of runtime file-path resolution. (#22349) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Feishu/Media: for inbound video messages that include both `file_key` (video) and `image_key` (thumbnail), prefer `file_key` when downloading media so video attachments are saved instead of silently failing on thumbnail keys. (#23633)
- Hooks/Loader: avoid redundant hook-module recompilation on gateway restart by skipping cache-busting for bundled hooks and using stable file metadata keys (`mtime+size`) for mutable workspace/managed/plugin hook imports. (#16953) Thanks @mudrii.
- Hooks/Cron: suppress duplicate main-session events for delivered hook turns and mark `SILENT_REPLY_TOKEN` (`NO_REPLY`) early exits as delivered to prevent hook context pollution. (#20678) Thanks @JonathanWorks.
- Providers/OpenRouter: inject `cache_control` on system prompts for OpenRouter Anthropic models to improve prompt-cache reuse. (#17473) Thanks @rrenamed.
- Installer/Smoke tests: remove legacy `OPENCLAW_USE_GUM` overrides from docker install-smoke runs so tests exercise installer auto TTY detection behavior directly.
- Providers/OpenRouter: allow pass-through OpenRouter and Opencode model IDs in live model filtering so custom routed model IDs are treated as modern refs. (#14312) Thanks @Joly0.
- Providers/OpenRouter: default reasoning to enabled when the selected model advertises `reasoning: true` and no session/directive override is set. (#22513) Thanks @zwffff.
- Providers/OpenRouter: map `/think` levels to `reasoning.effort` in embedded runs while preserving explicit `reasoning.max_tokens` payloads. (#17236) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve stored session provider when model IDs are vendor-prefixed (for example, `anthropic/...`) so follow-up turns do not incorrectly route to direct provider APIs. (#22753) Thanks @dndodson.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve the required `openrouter/` prefix for OpenRouter-native model IDs during model-ref normalization. (#12942) Thanks @omair445.
- Providers/OpenRouter: pass through provider routing parameters from model params.provider to OpenRouter request payloads for provider selection controls. (#17148) Thanks @carrotRakko.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve model allowlist entries containing OpenRouter preset paths (for example `openrouter/@preset/...`) by treating `/model ...@profile` auth-profile parsing as a suffix-only override. (#14120) Thanks @NotMainstream.
- Cron/Auth: propagate auth-profile resolution to isolated cron sessions so provider API keys are resolved the same way as main sessions, fixing 401 errors when using providers configured via auth-profiles. (#20689) Thanks @lailoo.
- Cron/Follow-up: pass resolved `agentDir` through isolated cron and queued follow-up embedded runs so auth/profile lookups stay scoped to the correct agent directory. (#22845) Thanks @seilk.
- Agents/Media: route tool-result `MEDIA:` extraction through shared parser validation so malformed prose like `MEDIA:-prefixed ...` is no longer treated as a local file path (prevents Telegram ENOENT tool-error overrides). (#18780) Thanks @HOYALIM.
- Logging: cap single log-file size with `logging.maxFileBytes` (default 500 MB) and suppress additional writes after cap hit to prevent disk exhaustion from repeated error storms.
- Memory/Remote HTTP: centralize remote memory HTTP calls behind a shared guarded helper (`withRemoteHttpResponse`) so embeddings and batch flows use one request/release path.
- Memory/Embeddings: apply configured remote-base host pinning (`allowedHostnames`) across OpenAI/Voyage/Gemini embedding requests to keep private/self-hosted endpoints working without cross-host drift. (#18198) Thanks @ianpcook.
- Memory/Batch: route OpenAI/Voyage/Gemini batch upload/create/status/download requests through the same guarded HTTP path for consistent SSRF policy enforcement.
- Memory/Index: detect memory source-set changes (for example enabling `sessions` after an existing memory-only index) and trigger a full reindex so existing session transcripts are indexed without requiring `--force`. (#17576) Thanks @TarsAI-Agent.
- Memory/Embeddings: enforce a per-input 8k safety cap before embedding batching and apply a conservative 2k fallback limit for local providers without declared input limits, preventing oversized session/memory chunks from triggering provider context-size failures during sync/indexing. (#6016) Thanks @batumilove.
- Memory/QMD: on Windows, resolve bare `qmd`/`mcporter` command names to npm shim executables (`.cmd`) before spawning, so qmd boot updates and mcporter-backed searches no longer fail with `spawn ... ENOENT` on default npm installs. (#23899) Thanks @arcbuilder-ai.
- Memory/QMD: parse plain-text `qmd collection list --json` output when older qmd builds ignore JSON mode, and retry memory searches once after re-ensuring managed collections when qmd returns `Collection not found ...`. (#23613) Thanks @leozhucn.
- Signal/RPC: guard malformed Signal RPC JSON responses with a clear status-scoped error and add regression coverage for invalid JSON responses. (#22995) Thanks @adhitShet.
- Gateway/Subagents: guard gateway and subagent session-key/message trim paths against undefined inputs to prevent early `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')` crashes during subagent spawn and wait flows.
- Agents/Workspace: guard `resolveUserPath` against undefined/null input to prevent `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')` crashes when workspace paths are missing in embedded runner flows.
- Auth/Profiles: keep active `cooldownUntil`/`disabledUntil` windows immutable across retries so mid-window failures cannot extend recovery indefinitely; only recompute a backoff window after the previous deadline has expired. This resolves cron/inbound retry loops that could trap gateways until manual `usageStats` cleanup. (#23516, #23536) Thanks @arosstale.
- Channels/Security: fail closed on missing provider group policy config by defaulting runtime group policy to `allowlist` (instead of inheriting `channels.defaults.groupPolicy`) when `channels.<provider>` is absent across message channels, and align runtime + security warnings/docs to the same fallback behavior (Slack, Discord, iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Matrix, Mattermost, Google Chat, IRC, Nextcloud Talk, Feishu, and Zalo user flows; plus Discord message/native-command paths). (#23367) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Gateway/Onboarding: harden remote gateway onboarding defaults and guidance by defaulting discovered direct URLs to `wss://`, rejecting insecure non-loopback `ws://` targets in onboarding validation, and expanding remote-security remediation messaging across gateway client/call/doctor flows. (#23476) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- CLI/Sessions: pass the configured sessions directory when resolving transcript paths in `agentCommand`, so custom `session.store` locations resume sessions reliably. Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Signal/Monitor: treat user-initiated abort shutdowns as clean exits when auto-started `signal-cli` is terminated, while still surfacing unexpected daemon exits as startup/runtime failures. (#23379) Thanks @frankekn.
- Channels/Dedupe: centralize plugin dedupe primitives in plugin SDK (memory + persistent), move Feishu inbound dedupe to a namespace-scoped persistent store, and reuse shared dedupe cache logic for Zalo webhook replay + Tlon processed-message tracking to reduce duplicate handling during reconnect/replay paths. (#23377) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Channels/Delivery: remove hardcoded WhatsApp delivery fallbacks; require explicit/session channel context or auto-pick the sole configured channel when unambiguous. (#23357) Thanks @lbo728.
- ACP/Gateway: wait for gateway hello before opening ACP requests, and fail fast on pre-hello connect failures to avoid startup hangs and early `gateway not connected` request races. (#23390) Thanks @janckerchen.
- Gateway/Auth: preserve `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` env override precedence for remote gateway call credentials after shared resolver refactors, preventing stale configured remote passwords from overriding runtime secret rotation.
- Gateway/Auth: preserve shared-token `gateway token mismatch` auth errors when `auth.token` fallback device-token checks fail, and reserve `device token mismatch` guidance for explicit `auth.deviceToken` failures.
- Gateway/Tools: when agent tools pass an allowlisted `gatewayUrl` override, resolve local override tokens from env/config fallback but keep remote overrides strict to `gateway.remote.token`, preventing local token leakage to remote targets.
- Gateway/Client: keep cached device-auth tokens on `device token mismatch` closes when the client used explicit shared token/password credentials, avoiding accidental pairing-token churn during explicit-auth failures.
- Node host/Exec: keep strict Windows allowlist behavior for `cmd.exe /c` shell-wrapper runs, and return explicit approval guidance when blocked (`SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss`).
- Control UI: show pairing-required guidance (commands + mobile tokenized URL reminder) when the dashboard disconnects with `1008 pairing required`.
- Security/Audit: add `openclaw security audit` detection for open group policies that expose runtime/filesystem tools without sandbox/workspace guards (`security.exposure.open_groups_with_runtime_or_fs`).
- Security/Audit: make `gateway.real_ip_fallback_enabled` severity conditional for loopback trusted-proxy setups (warn for loopback-only `trustedProxies`, critical when non-loopback proxies are trusted). (#23428) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Exec env: block request-scoped `HOME` and `ZDOTDIR` overrides in host exec env sanitizers (Node + macOS), preventing shell startup-file execution before allowlist-evaluated command bodies. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec env: block `SHELLOPTS`/`PS4` in host exec env sanitizers and restrict shell-wrapper (`bash|sh|zsh ... -c/-lc`) request env overrides to a small explicit allowlist (`TERM`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `COLORTERM`, `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`) on both node host and macOS companion paths, preventing xtrace prompt command-substitution allowlist bypasses. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- WhatsApp/Security: enforce `allowFrom` for direct-message outbound targets in all send modes (including `mode: "explicit"`), preventing sends to non-allowlisted numbers. (#20108) Thanks @zahlmann.
- Security/Exec approvals: fail closed on shell line continuations (`\\\n`/`\\\r\n`) and treat shell-wrapper execution as approval-required in allowlist mode, preventing `$\\` newline command-substitution bypasses. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: emit a startup security warning when insecure/dangerous config flags are enabled (including `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth=true`) and point operators to `openclaw security audit`.
- Security/Hooks auth: normalize hook auth rate-limit client IP keys so IPv4 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses share one throttle bucket, preventing dual-form auth-attempt budget bypasses. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: treat `env` and shell-dispatch wrappers as transparent during allowlist analysis on node-host and macOS companion paths so policy checks match the effective executable/inline shell payload instead of the wrapper binary, blocking wrapper-smuggled allowlist bypasses. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: require explicit safe-bin profiles for `tools.exec.safeBins` entries in allowlist mode (remove generic safe-bin profile fallback), and add `tools.exec.safeBinProfiles` for safe custom binaries so unprofiled interpreter-style entries cannot be treated as stdin-safe. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Channels: harden Slack external menu token handling by switching to CSPRNG tokens, validating token shape, requiring user identity for external option lookups, and avoiding fabricated timestamp `trigger_id` fallbacks; also switch Tlon Urbit channel IDs to CSPRNG UUIDs, centralize secure ID/token generation via shared infra helpers, and add a guardrail test to block new runtime `Date.now()+Math.random()` token/id patterns.
- Security/Hooks transforms: enforce symlink-safe containment for webhook transform module paths (including `hooks.transformsDir` and `hooks.mappings[].transform.module`) by resolving existing-path ancestors via realpath before import, while preserving in-root symlink support; add regression coverage for both escape and allow cases. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Telegram/WSL2: disable `autoSelectFamily` by default on WSL2 and memoize WSL2 detection in Telegram network decision logic to avoid repeated sync `/proc/version` probes on fetch/send paths. (#21916) Thanks @MizukiMachine.
- Telegram/Network: default Node 22+ DNS result ordering to `ipv4first` for Telegram fetch paths and add `OPENCLAW_TELEGRAM_DNS_RESULT_ORDER`/`channels.telegram.network.dnsResultOrder` overrides to reduce IPv6-path fetch failures. (#5405) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Telegram/Forward bursts: coalesce forwarded text+media updates through a dedicated forward lane debounce window that works with default inbound debounce config, while keeping forwarded control commands immediate. (#19476) thanks @napetrov.
- Telegram/Streaming: preserve archived draft preview mapping after flush and clean superseded reasoning preview bubbles so multi-message preview finals no longer cross-edit or orphan stale messages under send/rotation races. (#23202) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Replies: scope messaging-tool text/media dedupe to same-target sends only, so cross-target tool sends can no longer silently suppress Telegram final replies.
- Telegram/Replies: normalize `file://` and local-path media variants during messaging dedupe so equivalent media paths do not produce duplicate Telegram replies.
- Telegram/Replies: extract forwarded-origin context from unified reply targets (`reply_to_message` and `external_reply`) so forward+comment metadata is preserved across partial reply shapes. (#9720) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram/Polling: persist a safe update-offset watermark bounded by pending updates so crash/restart cannot skip queued lower `update_id` updates after out-of-order completion. (#23284) thanks @frankekn.
- Telegram/Polling: force-restart stuck runner instances when recoverable unhandled network rejections escape the polling task path, so polling resumes instead of silently stalling. (#19721) Thanks @jg-noncelogic.
- Slack/Slash commands: preserve the Bolt app receiver when registering external select options handlers so monitor startup does not crash on runtimes that require bound `app.options` calls. (#23209) Thanks @0xgaia.
- Slack/Telegram slash sessions: await session metadata persistence before dispatch so first-turn native slash runs do not race session-origin metadata updates. (#23065) thanks @hydro13.
- Slack/Queue routing: preserve string `thread_ts` values through collect-mode queue drain and DM `deliveryContext` updates so threaded follow-ups do not leak to the main channel when Slack thread IDs are strings. (#11934) Thanks @sandieman2 and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Native commands: set `ctx.Provider="telegram"` for native slash-command context so elevated gate checks resolve provider correctly (fixes `provider (ctx.Provider)` failures in `/elevated` flows). (#23748) Thanks @serhii12.
- Agents/Ollama: preserve unsafe integer tool-call arguments as exact strings during NDJSON parsing, preventing large numeric IDs from being rounded before tool execution. (#23170) Thanks @BestJoester.
- Cron/Gateway: keep `cron.list` and `cron.status` responsive during startup catch-up by avoiding a long-held cron lock while missed jobs execute. (#23106) Thanks @jayleekr.
- Gateway/Config reload: compare array-valued config paths structurally during diffing so unchanged `memory.qmd.paths` and `memory.qmd.scope.rules` no longer trigger false restart-required reloads. (#23185) Thanks @rex05ai.
- Gateway/Config reload: retry short-lived missing config snapshots during reload before skipping, preventing atomic-write unlink windows from triggering restart loops. (#23343) Thanks @lbo728.
- Cron/Scheduling: validate runtime cron expressions before schedule/stagger evaluation so malformed persisted jobs report a clear `invalid cron schedule: expr is required` error instead of crashing with `undefined.trim` failures and auto-disable churn. (#23223) Thanks @asimons81.
- Memory/QMD: migrate legacy unscoped collection bindings (for example `memory-root`) to per-agent scoped names (for example `memory-root-main`) during startup when safe, so QMD-backed `memory_search` no longer fails with `Collection not found` after upgrades. (#23228, #20727) Thanks @JLDynamics and @AaronFaby.
- Memory/QMD: normalize Han-script BM25 search queries before invoking `qmd search` so mixed CJK+Latin prompts no longer return empty results due to tokenizer mismatch. (#23426) Thanks @LunaLee0130.
- TUI/Input: enable multiline-paste burst coalescing on macOS Terminal.app and iTerm so pasted blocks no longer submit line-by-line as separate messages. (#18809) Thanks @fwends.
- TUI/RTL: isolate right-to-left script lines (Arabic/Hebrew ranges) with Unicode bidi isolation marks in TUI text sanitization so RTL assistant output no longer renders in reversed visual order in terminal chat panes. (#21936) Thanks @Asm3r96.
- TUI/Status: request immediate renders after setting `sending`/`waiting` activity states so in-flight runs always show visible progress indicators instead of appearing idle until completion. (#21549) Thanks @13Guinness.
- TUI/Input: arm Ctrl+C exit timing when clearing non-empty composer text and add a SIGINT fallback path so double Ctrl+C exits remain responsive during active runs instead of requiring an extra press or appearing stuck. (#23407) Thanks @tinybluedev.
- Agents/Fallbacks: treat JSON payloads with `type: "api_error"` + `"Internal server error"` as transient failover errors so Anthropic 500-style failures trigger model fallback. (#23193) Thanks @jarvis-lane.
- Agents/Google: sanitize non-base64 `thought_signature`/`thoughtSignature` values from assistant replay transcripts for native Google Gemini requests while preserving valid signatures and tool-call order. (#23457) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Transcripts: validate assistant tool-call names (syntax/length + registered tool allowlist) before transcript persistence and during replay sanitization so malformed failover tool names no longer poison sessions with repeated provider HTTP 400 errors. (#23324) Thanks @johnsantry.
- Agents/Mistral: sanitize tool-call IDs in the embedded agent loop and generate strict provider-safe pending tool-call IDs, preventing Mistral strict9 `HTTP 400` failures on tool continuations. (#23698) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Compaction: strip stale assistant usage snapshots from pre-compaction turns when replaying history after a compaction summary so context-token estimation no longer reuses pre-compaction totals and immediately re-triggers destructive follow-up compactions. (#19127) Thanks @tedwatson.
- Agents/Replies: emit a default completion acknowledgement (`✅ Done.`) only for direct/private tool-only completions with no final assistant text, while suppressing synthetic acknowledgements for channel/group sessions and runs that already delivered output via messaging tools. (#22834) Thanks @Oldshue.
- Agents/Subagents: honor `tools.subagents.tools.alsoAllow` and explicit subagent `allow` entries when resolving built-in subagent deny defaults, so explicitly granted tools (for example `sessions_send`) are no longer blocked unless re-denied in `tools.subagents.tools.deny`. (#23359) Thanks @goren-beehero.
- Agents/Subagents: make announce call timeouts configurable via `agents.defaults.subagents.announceTimeoutMs` and restore a 60s default to prevent false timeout failures on slower announce paths. (#22719) Thanks @Valadon.
- Agents/Diagnostics: include resolved lifecycle error text in `embedded run agent end` warnings so UI/TUI “Connection error” runs expose actionable provider failure reasons in gateway logs. (#23054) Thanks @Raize.
- Agents/Auth profiles: resolve `agentCommand` session scope before choosing `agentDir`/workspace so resumed runs no longer read auth from `agents/main/agent` when the resolved session belongs to a different/default agent (for example `agent:exec:*` sessions). (#24016) Thanks @abersonFAC.
- Agents/Auth profiles: skip auth-profile cooldown writes for timeout failures in embedded runner rotation so model/network timeouts do not poison same-provider fallback model selection while still allowing in-turn account rotation. (#22622) Thanks @vageeshkumar.
- Plugins/Hooks: run legacy `before_agent_start` once per agent turn and reuse that result across model-resolve and prompt-build compatibility paths, preventing duplicate hook side effects (for example duplicate external API calls). (#23289) Thanks @ksato8710.
- Models/Config: default missing Anthropic provider/model `api` fields to `anthropic-messages` during config validation so custom relay model entries are preserved instead of being dropped by runtime model registry validation. (#23332) Thanks @bigbigmonkey123.
- Gateway/Pairing: preserve existing approved token scopes when processing repair pairings that omit `scopes`, preventing empty-scope token regressions on reconnecting clients. (#21906) Thanks @paki81.
- Memory/QMD: add optional `memory.qmd.mcporter` search routing so QMD `query/search/vsearch` can run through mcporter keep-alive flows (including multi-collection paths) to reduce cold starts, while keeping searches on agent-scoped QMD state for consistent recall. (#19617) Thanks @nicole-luxe and @vignesh07.
- Infra/Network: classify undici `TypeError: fetch failed` as transient in unhandled-rejection detection even when nested causes are unclassified, preventing avoidable gateway crash loops on flaky networks. (#14345) Thanks @Unayung.
- Telegram/Retry: classify undici `TypeError: fetch failed` as recoverable in both polling and send retry paths so transient fetch failures no longer fail fast. (#16699) thanks @Glucksberg.
- Docs/Telegram: correct Node 22+ network defaults (`autoSelectFamily`, `dnsResultOrder`) and clarify Telegram setup does not use positional `openclaw channels login telegram`. (#23609) Thanks @ryanbastic.
- BlueBubbles/DM history: restore DM backfill context with account-scoped rolling history, bounded backfill retries, and safer history payload limits. (#20302) Thanks @Ryan-Haines.
- BlueBubbles/Private API cache: treat unknown (`null`) private-API cache status as disabled for send/attachment/reply flows to avoid stale-cache 500s, and log a warning when reply/effect features are requested while capability is unknown. (#23459) Thanks @echoVic.
- BlueBubbles/Webhooks: accept inbound/reaction webhook payloads when BlueBubbles omits `handle` but provides DM `chatGuid`, and harden payload extraction for array/string-wrapped message bodies so valid webhook events no longer get rejected as unparseable. (#23275) Thanks @toph31.
- Security/Audit: add `openclaw security audit` finding `gateway.nodes.allow_commands_dangerous` for risky `gateway.nodes.allowCommands` overrides, with severity upgraded to critical on remote gateway exposure.
- Gateway/Control plane: reduce cross-client write limiter contention by adding `connId` fallback keying when device ID and client IP are both unavailable.
- Security/Config: block prototype-key traversal during config merge patch and legacy migration merge helpers (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) to prevent prototype pollution during config mutation flows. (#22968) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Security/Shell env: validate login-shell executable paths for shell-env fallback (`/etc/shells` + trusted prefixes), block `SHELL`/`HOME`/`ZDOTDIR` in config env ingestion before fallback execution, and sanitize fallback shell exec env to pin `HOME` to the real user home while dropping `ZDOTDIR` and other dangerous startup vars. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Network/SSRF: enable `autoSelectFamily` on pinned undici dispatchers (with attempt timeout) so IPv6-unreachable environments can quickly fall back to IPv4 for guarded fetch paths. (#19950) Thanks @ENAwareness.
- Security/Config: make parsed chat allowlist checks fail closed when `allowFrom` is empty, restoring expected DM/pairing gating.
- Security/Exec: in non-default setups that manually add `sort` to `tools.exec.safeBins`, block `sort --compress-program` so allowlist-mode safe-bin checks cannot bypass approval. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: when users choose `allow-always` for shell-wrapper commands (for example `/bin/zsh -lc ...`), persist allowlist patterns for the inner executable(s) instead of the wrapper shell binary, preventing accidental broad shell allowlisting in moderate mode. (#23276) Thanks @xrom2863.
- Security/Exec: fail closed when `tools.exec.host=sandbox` is configured/requested but sandbox runtime is unavailable. (#23398) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/macOS app beta: enforce path-only `system.run` allowlist matching (drop basename matches like `echo`), migrate legacy basename entries to last resolved paths when available, and harden shell-chain handling to fail closed on unsafe parse/control syntax (including quoted command substitution/backticks). This is an optional allowlist-mode feature; default installs remain deny-by-default. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Agents: auto-generate and persist a dedicated `commands.ownerDisplaySecret` when `commands.ownerDisplay=hash`, remove gateway token fallback from owner-ID prompt hashing across CLI and embedded agent runners, and centralize owner-display secret resolution in one shared helper. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/SSRF: expand IPv4 fetch guard blocking to include RFC special-use/non-global ranges (including benchmarking, TEST-NET, multicast, and reserved/broadcast blocks), centralize range checks into a single CIDR policy table, and reuse one shared host/IP classifier across literal + DNS checks to reduce classifier drift. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @princeeismond-dot for reporting.
- Security/SSRF: block RFC2544 benchmarking range (`198.18.0.0/15`) across direct and embedded-IP paths, and normalize IPv6 dotted-quad transition literals (for example `::127.0.0.1`, `64:ff9b::8.8.8.8`) in shared IP parsing/classification.
- Security/Archive: block zip symlink escapes during archive extraction.
- Security/Media sandbox: keep tmp media allowance for absolute tmp paths only and enforce symlink-escape checks before sandbox-validated reads, preventing tmp symlink exfiltration and relative `../` sandbox escapes when sandboxes live under tmp. (#17892) Thanks @dashed.
- Browser/Upload: accept canonical in-root upload paths when the configured uploads directory is a symlink alias (for example `/tmp` -> `/private/tmp` on macOS), so browser upload validation no longer rejects valid files during client->server revalidation. (#23300, #23222, #22848) Thanks @bgaither4, @parkerati, and @Nabsku.
- Security/Discord: add `openclaw security audit` warnings for name/tag-based Discord allowlist entries (DM allowlists, guild/channel `users`, and pairing-store entries), highlighting slug-collision risk while keeping name-based matching supported, and canonicalize resolved Discord allowlist names to IDs at runtime without rewriting config files. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: block node-role connections when device identity metadata is missing.
- Security/Media: enforce inbound media byte limits during download/read across Discord, Telegram, Zalo, Microsoft Teams, and BlueBubbles to prevent oversized payload memory spikes before rejection. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Media/Understanding: preserve `application/pdf` MIME classification during text-like file heuristics so PDF uploads use PDF extraction paths instead of being inlined as raw text. (#23191) Thanks @claudeplay2026-byte.
- Security/Control UI: block symlink-based out-of-root static file reads by enforcing realpath containment and file-identity checks when serving Control UI assets and SPA fallback `index.html`. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway avatars: block symlink traversal during local avatar `data:` URL resolution by enforcing realpath containment and file-identity checks before reads. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Control UI: centralize avatar URL/path validation across gateway/config helpers and enforce a 2 MB max size for local agent avatar files before `/avatar` resolution, reducing oversized-avatar memory risk without changing supported avatar formats.
- Security/Control UI avatars: harden `/avatar/:agentId` local avatar serving by rejecting symlink paths and requiring fd-level file identity + size checks before reads. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/MSTeams media: enforce allowlist checks for SharePoint reference attachment URLs and redirect targets during Graph-backed media fetches so redirect chains cannot escape configured media host boundaries. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/MSTeams media: route attachment auth-retry and Graph SharePoint download redirects through shared `safeFetch` so each hop is validated with allowlist + DNS/IP checks across the full redirect chain. (#23598) Thanks @Asm3r96 and @lewiswigmore.
- Security/macOS discovery: fail closed for unresolved discovery endpoints by clearing stale remote selection values, use resolved service host only for SSH target derivation, and keep remote URL config aligned with resolved endpoint availability. (#21618) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Chat/Usage/TUI: strip synthetic inbound metadata blocks (including `Conversation info` and trailing `Untrusted context` channel metadata wrappers) from displayed conversation history so internal prompt context no longer leaks into user-visible logs.
- CI/Tests: fix TypeScript case-table typing and lint assertion regressions so `pnpm check` passes again after Synology Chat landing. (#23012) Thanks @druide67.
- Security/Browser relay: harden extension relay auth token handling for `/extension` and `/cdp` pathways.
- Cron: persist `delivered` state in cron job records so delivery failures remain visible in status and logs. (#19174) Thanks @simonemacario.
- Config/Doctor: only repair the OAuth credentials directory when affected channels are configured, avoiding fresh-install noise.
- Config/Channels: whitelist `channels.modelByChannel` in config validation and exclude it from plugin auto-enable channel detection so model overrides no longer trigger `unknown channel id` validation errors or bogus `modelByChannel` plugin enables. (#23412) Thanks @ProspectOre.
- Config/Bindings: allow optional `bindings[].comment` in strict config validation so annotated binding entries no longer fail load. (#23458) Thanks @echoVic.
- Usage/Pricing: correct MiniMax M2.5 pricing defaults to fix inflated cost reporting. (#22755) Thanks @miloudbelarebia.
- Gateway/Daemon: verify gateway health after daemon restart.
- Agents/UI text: stop rewriting normal assistant billing/payment language outside explicit error contexts. (#17834) Thanks @niceysam.

- Auto-reply/UI: add model fallback lifecycle visibility in verbose logs, /status active-model context with fallback reason, and cohesive WebUI fallback indicators. (#20704) Thanks @joshavant.
- MSTeams: dedupe sent-message cache storage by removing duplicate per-message Set storage and using timestamps Map keys as the single membership source. (#22514) Thanks @TaKO8Ki.
- Agents/Subagents: default subagent spawn depth now uses shared `maxSpawnDepth=2`, enabling depth-1 orchestrator spawning by default while keeping depth policy checks consistent across spawn and prompt paths. (#22223) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Security/Agents: make owner-ID obfuscation use a dedicated HMAC secret from configuration (`ownerDisplaySecret`) and update hashing behavior so obfuscation is decoupled from gateway token handling for improved control. (#7343) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Infra: switch gateway lock and tool-call synthetic IDs from SHA-1 to SHA-256 with unchanged truncation length to strengthen hash basis while keeping deterministic behavior and lock key format. (#7343) Thanks @vincentkoc.

- Dependencies/Unused Dependencies: remove or scope unused root and extension deps (`@larksuiteoapi/node-sdk`, `signal-utils`, `ollama`, `lit`, `@lit/context`, `@lit-labs/signals`, `@microsoft/agents-hosting-express`, `@microsoft/agents-hosting-extensions-teams`, and plugin-local `openclaw` devDeps in `extensions/open-prose`, `extensions/lobster`, and `extensions/llm-task`). (#22471, #22495) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies/A2UI: harden dependency resolution after root cleanup (resolve `lit`, `@lit/context`, `@lit-labs/signals`, and `signal-utils` from workspace/root) and simplify bundling fallback behavior, including `pnpm dlx rolldown` compatibility. (#22481, #22507) Thanks @vincentkoc.

### Fixes

- Agents/Bootstrap: skip malformed bootstrap files with missing/invalid paths instead of crashing agent sessions; hooks using `filePath` (or non-string `path`) are skipped with a warning. (#22693, #22698) Thanks @arosstale.
- Security/Agents: cap embedded Pi runner outer retry loop with a higher profile-aware dynamic limit (32-160 attempts) and return an explicit `retry_limit` error payload when retries never converge, preventing unbounded internal retry cycles (`GHSA-76m6-pj3w-v7mf`).
- Telegram: detect duplicate bot-token ownership across Telegram accounts at startup/status time, mark secondary accounts as not configured with an explicit fix message, and block duplicate account startup before polling to avoid endless `getUpdates` conflict loops.
- Agents/Tool images: include source filenames in `agents/tool-images` resize logs so compression events can be traced back to specific files.
- Providers/OAuth: harden Qwen and Chutes refresh handling by validating refresh response expiry values and preserving prior refresh tokens when providers return empty refresh token fields, with regression coverage for empty-token responses.
- Models/Kimi-Coding: add missing implicit provider template for `kimi-coding` with correct `anthropic-messages` API type and base URL, fixing 403 errors when using Kimi for Coding. (#22409)
- Auto-reply/Tools: forward `senderIsOwner` through embedded queued/followup runner params so owner-only tools remain available for authorized senders. (#22296) thanks @hcoj.
- Discord: restore model picker back navigation when a provider is missing and document the Discord picker flow. (#21458) Thanks @pejmanjohn and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Memory/QMD: respect per-agent `memorySearch.enabled=false` during gateway QMD startup initialization, split multi-collection QMD searches into per-collection queries (`search`/`vsearch`/`query`) to avoid sparse-term drops, prefer collection-hinted doc resolution to avoid stale-hash collisions, retry boot updates on transient lock/timeout failures, skip `qmd embed` in BM25-only `search` mode (including `memory index --force`), and serialize embed runs globally with failure backoff to prevent CPU storms on multi-agent hosts. (#20581, #21590, #20513, #20001, #21266, #21583, #20346, #19493) Thanks @danielrevivo, @zanderkrause, @sunyan034-cmd, @tilleulenspiegel, @dae-oss, @adamlongcreativellc, @jonathanadams96, and @kiliansitel.
- Memory/Builtin: prevent automatic sync races with manager shutdown by skipping post-close sync starts and waiting for in-flight sync before closing SQLite, so `onSearch`/`onSessionStart` no longer fail with `database is not open` in ephemeral CLI flows. (#20556, #7464) Thanks @FuzzyTG and @henrybottter.
- Providers/Copilot: drop persisted assistant `thinking` blocks for Claude models (while preserving turn structure/tool blocks) so follow-up requests no longer fail on invalid `thinkingSignature` payloads. (#19459) Thanks @jackheuberger.
- Providers/Copilot: add `claude-sonnet-4.6` and `claude-sonnet-4.5` to the default GitHub Copilot model catalog and add coverage for model-list/definition helpers. (#20270, fixes #20091) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Auto-reply/WebChat: avoid defaulting inbound runtime channel labels to unrelated providers (for example `whatsapp`) for webchat sessions so channel-specific formatting guidance stays accurate. (#21534) Thanks @lbo728.
- Status: include persisted `cacheRead`/`cacheWrite` in session summaries so compact `/status` output consistently shows cache hit percentages from real session data.
- Sessions/Usage: persist `totalTokens` from `promptTokens` snapshots even when providers omit structured usage payloads, so session history/status no longer regress to `unknown` token utilization for otherwise successful runs. (#21819) Thanks @zymclaw.
- Heartbeat/Cron: restore interval heartbeat behavior so missing `HEARTBEAT.md` no longer suppresses runs (only effectively empty files skip), preserving prompt-driven and tagged-cron execution paths.
- WhatsApp/Cron/Heartbeat: enforce allowlisted routing for implicit scheduled/system delivery by merging pairing-store + configured `allowFrom` recipients, selecting authorized recipients when last-route context points to a non-allowlisted chat, and preventing heartbeat fan-out to recent unauthorized chats.
- Heartbeat/Active hours: constrain active-hours `24` sentinel parsing to `24:00` in time validation so invalid values like `24:30` are rejected early. (#21410) thanks @adhitShet.
- Heartbeat: treat `activeHours` windows with identical `start`/`end` times as zero-width (always outside the window) instead of always-active. (#21408) thanks @adhitShet.
- CLI/Pairing: default `pairing list` and `pairing approve` to the sole available pairing channel when omitted, so TUI-only setups can recover from `pairing required` without guessing channel arguments. (#21527) Thanks @losts1.
- TUI/Pairing: show explicit pairing-required recovery guidance after gateway disconnects that return `pairing required`, including approval steps to unblock quickstart TUI hatching on fresh installs. (#21841) Thanks @nicolinux.
- TUI/Input: suppress duplicate backspace events arriving in the same input burst window so SSH sessions no longer delete two characters per backspace press in the composer. (#19318) Thanks @eheimer.
- TUI/Models: scope `models.list` to the configured model allowlist (`agents.defaults.models`) so `/model` picker no longer floods with unrelated catalog entries by default. (#18816) Thanks @fwends.
- TUI/Heartbeat: suppress heartbeat ACK/prompt noise in chat streaming when `showOk` is disabled, while still preserving non-ACK heartbeat alerts in final output. (#20228) Thanks @bhalliburton.
- TUI/History: cap chat-log component growth and prune stale render nodes/references so large default history loads no longer overflow render recursion with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`. (#18068) Thanks @JaniJegoroff.
- Memory/QMD: diversify mixed-source search ranking when both session and memory collections are present so session transcript hits no longer crowd out durable memory-file matches in top results. (#19913) Thanks @alextempr.
- Memory/Tools: return explicit `unavailable` warnings/actions from `memory_search` when embedding/provider failures occur (including quota exhaustion), so disabled memory does not look like an empty recall result. (#21894) Thanks @XBS9.
- Session/Startup: require the `/new` and `/reset` greeting path to run Session Startup file-reading instructions before responding, so daily memory startup context is not skipped on fresh-session greetings. (#22338) Thanks @armstrong-pv.
- Auth/Onboarding: align OAuth profile-id config mapping with stored credential IDs for OpenAI Codex and Chutes flows, preventing `provider:default` mismatches when OAuth returns email-scoped credentials. (#12692) thanks @mudrii.
- Provider/HTTP: treat HTTP 503 as failover-eligible for LLM provider errors. (#21086) Thanks @Protocol-zero-0.
- Slack: pass `recipient_team_id` / `recipient_user_id` through Slack native streaming calls so `chat.startStream`/`appendStream`/`stopStream` work reliably across DMs and Slack Connect setups, and disable block streaming when native streaming is active. (#20988) Thanks @Dithilli. Earlier recipient-ID groundwork was contributed in #20377 by @AsserAl1012.
- CLI/Config: add canonical `--strict-json` parsing for `config set` and keep `--json` as a legacy alias to reduce help/behavior drift. (#21332) thanks @adhitShet.
- CLI/Config: preserve explicitly unset config paths in persisted JSON after writes so `openclaw config unset <path>` no longer re-introduces defaulted keys (for example `commands.ownerDisplay`) through schema normalization. (#22984) Thanks @aronchick.
- CLI: keep `openclaw -v` as a root-only version alias so subcommand `-v, --verbose` flags (for example ACP/hooks/skills) are no longer intercepted globally. (#21303) thanks @adhitShet.
- Memory: return empty snippets when `memory_get`/QMD read files that have not been created yet, and harden memory indexing/session helpers against ENOENT races so missing Markdown no longer crashes tools. (#20680) Thanks @pahdo.
- Telegram/Streaming: always clean up draft previews even when dispatch throws before fallback handling, preventing orphaned preview messages during failed runs. (#19041) thanks @mudrii.
- Telegram/Streaming: split reasoning and answer draft preview lanes to prevent cross-lane overwrites, and ignore literal `<think>` tags inside inline/fenced code snippets so sample markup is not misrouted as reasoning. (#20774) Thanks @obviyus.

- Telegram/Status reactions: refresh stall timers on repeated phase updates and honor ack-reaction scope when lifecycle reactions are enabled, preventing false stall emojis and unwanted group reactions. Thanks @wolly-tundracube and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Telegram/Status reactions: keep lifecycle reactions active when available-reactions lookup fails by falling back to unrestricted variant selection instead of suppressing reaction updates. (#22380) thanks @obviyus.
- Discord/Events: await `DiscordMessageListener` message handlers so regular `MESSAGE_CREATE` traffic is processed through queue ordering/timeout flow instead of fire-and-forget drops. (#22396) Thanks @sIlENtbuffER.
- Discord/Streaming: apply `replyToMode: first` only to the first Discord chunk so block-streamed replies do not spam mention pings. (#20726) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow for the report.
- Discord/Components: map DM channel targets back to user-scoped component sessions so button/select interactions stay in the main DM session. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/Allowlist: lazy-load guild lists when resolving Discord user allowlists so ID-only entries resolve even if guild fetch fails. (#20208) Thanks @zhangjunmengyang.
- Discord/Gateway: handle close code 4014 (missing privileged gateway intents) without crashing the gateway. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: ingest inbound stickers as media so sticker-only messages and forwarded stickers are visible to agents. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Auto-reply/Runner: emit `onAgentRunStart` only after agent lifecycle or tool activity begins (and only once per run), so fallback preflight errors no longer mark runs as started. (#21165) Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Auto-reply/Tool results: serialize tool-result delivery and keep the delivery chain progressing after individual failures so concurrent tool outputs preserve user-visible ordering. (#21231) thanks @ahdernasr.
- Auto-reply/Prompt caching: restore prefix-cache stability by keeping inbound system metadata session-stable and moving per-message IDs (`message_id`, `message_id_full`, `reply_to_id`, `sender_id`) into untrusted conversation context. (#20597) Thanks @anisoptera.
- iOS/Watch: add actionable watch approval/reject controls and quick-reply actions so watch-originated approvals and responses can be sent directly from notification flows. (#21996) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Watch: refresh iOS and watch app icon assets with the lobster icon set to keep phone/watch branding aligned. (#21997) Thanks @mbelinky.

- iOS/Gateway/Tools: prefer uniquely connected node matches when duplicate display names exist, surface actionable `nodes invoke` pairing-required guidance with request IDs, and refresh active iOS gateway registration after location-capability setting changes so capability updates apply immediately. (#22120) thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Auth: require `gateway.trustedProxies` to include a loopback proxy address when `auth.mode="trusted-proxy"` and `bind="loopback"`, preventing same-host proxy misconfiguration from silently blocking auth. (#22082, follow-up to #20097) thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Auth: allow trusted-proxy mode with loopback bind for same-host reverse-proxy deployments, while still requiring configured `gateway.trustedProxies`. (#20097) thanks @xinhuagu.
- Gateway/Auth: allow authenticated clients across roles/scopes to call `health` while preserving role and scope enforcement for non-health methods. (#19699) thanks @Nachx639.
- Gateway/Hooks: include transform export name in hook-transform cache keys so distinct exports from the same module do not reuse the wrong cached transform function. (#13855) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Gateway/Control UI: return 404 for missing static-asset paths instead of serving SPA fallback HTML, while preserving client-route fallback behavior for extensionless and non-asset dotted paths. (#12060) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Gateway/Pairing: prevent device-token rotate scope escalation by enforcing an approved-scope baseline, preserving approved scopes across metadata updates, and rejecting rotate requests that exceed approved role scope implications. (#20703) thanks @coygeek.
- Gateway/Pairing: clear persisted paired-device state when the gateway client closes with `device token mismatch` (`1008`) so reconnect flows can cleanly re-enter pairing. (#22071) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Config: allow `gateway.customBindHost` in strict config validation when `gateway.bind="custom"` so valid custom bind-host configurations no longer fail startup. (#20318, fixes #20289) Thanks @MisterGuy420.
- Gateway/Pairing: tolerate legacy paired devices missing `roles`/`scopes` metadata in websocket upgrade checks and backfill metadata on reconnect. (#21447, fixes #21236) Thanks @joshavant.

- Cron: honor `cron.maxConcurrentRuns` in the timer loop so due jobs can execute up to the configured parallelism instead of always running serially. (#11595) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Agents/Compaction: restore embedded compaction safeguard/context-pruning extension loading in production by wiring bundled extension factories into the resource loader instead of runtime file-path resolution. (#22349) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Agents/Subagents: restore announce-chain delivery to agent injection, defer nested announce output until descendant follow-up content is ready, and prevent descendant deferrals from consuming announce retry budget so deep chains do not drop final completions. (#22223) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/System Prompt: label allowlisted senders as authorized senders to avoid implying ownership. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Agents/Tool display: fix exec cwd suffix inference so `pushd ... && popd ... && <command>` does not keep stale `(in <dir>)` context in summaries. (#21925) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Agents/Google: flatten residual nested `anyOf`/`oneOf` unions in Gemini tool-schema cleanup so Cloud Code Assist no longer rejects unsupported union keywords that survive earlier simplification. (#22825) Thanks @Oceanswave.
- Tools/web_search: handle xAI Responses API payloads that emit top-level `output_text` blocks (without a `message` wrapper) so Grok web_search no longer returns `No response` for those results. (#20508) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Failover: treat non-default override runs as direct fallback-to-configured-primary (skip configured fallback chain), normalize default-model detection for provider casing/whitespace, and add regression coverage for override/auth error paths. (#18820) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Docker/Build: include `ownerDisplay` in `CommandsSchema` object-level defaults so Docker `pnpm build` no longer fails with `TS2769` during plugin SDK d.ts generation. (#22558) Thanks @obviyus.
- Docker/Browser: install Playwright Chromium into `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright` and set `node:node` ownership so browser binaries are available to the runtime user in browser-enabled images. (#22585) thanks @obviyus.
- Hooks/Session memory: trigger bundled `session-memory` persistence on both `/new` and `/reset` so reset flows no longer skip markdown transcript capture before archival. (#21382) Thanks @mofesolapaul.
- Dependencies/Agents: bump embedded Pi SDK packages (`@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`) to `0.54.0`. (#21578) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Config/Agents: expose Pi compaction tuning values `agents.defaults.compaction.reserveTokens` and `agents.defaults.compaction.keepRecentTokens` in config schema/types and apply them in embedded Pi runner settings overrides with floor enforcement via `reserveTokensFloor`. (#21568) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Docker: pin base images to SHA256 digests in Docker builds to prevent mutable tag drift. (#7734) Thanks @coygeek.
- Docker: run build steps as the `node` user and use `COPY --chown` to avoid recursive ownership changes, trimming image size and layer churn. Thanks @huntharo.
- Config/Memory: restore schema help/label metadata for hybrid `mmr` and `temporalDecay` settings so configuration surfaces show correct names and guidance. (#18786) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Skills/SonosCLI: add troubleshooting guidance for `sonos discover` failures on macOS direct mode (`sendto: no route to host`) and sandbox network restrictions (`bind: operation not permitted`). (#21316) Thanks @huntharo.
- macOS/Build: default release packaging to `BUNDLE_ID=ai.openclaw.mac` in `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh`, so Sparkle feed URL is retained and auto-update no longer fails with an empty appcast feed. (#19750) thanks @loganprit.
- Signal/Outbound: preserve case for Base64 group IDs during outbound target normalization so cross-context routing and policy checks no longer break when group IDs include uppercase characters. (#5578) Thanks @heyhudson.
- Anthropic/Agents: preserve required pi-ai default OAuth beta headers when `context1m` injects `anthropic-beta`, preventing 401 auth failures for `sk-ant-oat-*` tokens. (#19789, fixes #19769) Thanks @minupla.
- Security/Exec: block unquoted heredoc body expansion tokens in shell allowlist analysis, reject unterminated heredocs, and require explicit approval for allowlisted heredoc execution on gateway hosts to prevent heredoc substitution allowlist bypass. Thanks @torturado for reporting.
- macOS/Security: evaluate `system.run` allowlists per shell segment in macOS node runtime and companion exec host (including chained shell operators), fail closed on shell/process substitution parsing, and require explicit approval on unsafe parse cases to prevent allowlist bypass via `rawCommand` chaining. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- WhatsApp/Security: enforce allowlist JID authorization for reaction actions so authenticated callers cannot target non-allowlisted chats by forging `chatJid` + valid `messageId` pairs. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- ACP/Security: escape control and delimiter characters in ACP `resource_link` title/URI metadata before prompt interpolation to prevent metadata-driven prompt injection through resource links. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- TTS/Security: make model-driven provider switching opt-in by default (`messages.tts.modelOverrides.allowProvider=false` unless explicitly enabled), while keeping voice/style overrides available, to reduce prompt-injection-driven provider hops and unexpected TTS cost escalation. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Agents: keep overflow compaction retry budgeting global across tool-result truncation recovery so successful truncation cannot reset the overflow retry counter and amplify retry/cost cycles. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- BlueBubbles/Security: require webhook token authentication for all BlueBubbles webhook requests (including loopback/proxied setups), removing passwordless webhook fallback behavior. Thanks @zpbrent.
- iOS/Security: force `https://` for non-loopback manual gateway hosts during iOS onboarding to block insecure remote transport URLs. (#21969) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Security: remove shared-IP fallback for canvas endpoints and require token or session capability for canvas access. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Gateway/Security: require secure context and paired-device checks for Control UI auth even when `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth` is set, and align audit messaging with the hardened behavior. (#20684) Thanks @coygeek and @Vasco0x4 for reporting.
- Gateway/Security: scope tokenless Tailscale forwarded-header auth to Control UI websocket auth only, so HTTP gateway routes still require token/password even on trusted hosts. Thanks @zpbrent for reporting.
- Docker/Security: run E2E and install-sh test images as non-root by adding appuser directives. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Skills/Security: sanitize skill env overrides to block unsafe runtime injection variables and only allow sensitive keys when declared in skill metadata, with warnings for suspicious values. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Commands: block prototype-key injection in runtime `/debug` overrides and require own-property checks for gated command flags (`bash`, `config`, `debug`) so inherited prototype values cannot enable privileged commands. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Browser: block non-network browser navigation protocols (including `file:`, `data:`, and `javascript:`) while preserving `about:blank`, preventing local file reads via browser tool navigation. Thanks @q1uf3ng for reporting.
- Security/Exec: block shell startup-file env injection (`BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `BASH_FUNC_*`, `LD_*`, `DYLD_*`) across config env ingestion, node-host inherited environment sanitization, and macOS exec host runtime to prevent pre-command execution from attacker-controlled environment variables. Thanks @tdjackey.

- Security/Net: strip sensitive headers (`Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Cookie2`) on cross-origin redirects in `fetchWithSsrFGuard` to prevent credential forwarding across origin boundaries. (#20313) Thanks @afurm.
- Security/Systemd: reject CR/LF in systemd unit environment values and fix argument escaping so generated units cannot be injected with extra directives. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Tools: add per-wrapper random IDs to untrusted-content markers from `wrapExternalContent`/`wrapWebContent`, preventing marker spoofing from escaping content boundaries. (#19009) Thanks @Whoaa512.
- Shared/Security: reject insecure deep links that use `ws://` non-loopback gateway URLs to prevent plaintext remote websocket configuration. (#21970) Thanks @mbelinky.
- macOS/Security: reject non-loopback `ws://` remote gateway URLs in macOS remote config to block insecure plaintext websocket endpoints. (#21971) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Browser/Security: block upload path symlink escapes so browser upload sources cannot traverse outside the allowed workspace via symlinked paths. (#21972) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Security/Dependencies: bump transitive `hono` usage to `4.11.10` to incorporate timing-safe authentication comparison hardening for `basicAuth`/`bearerAuth` (`GHSA-gq3j-xvxp-8hrf`). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Gateway: parse `X-Forwarded-For` with trust-preserving semantics when requests come from configured trusted proxies, preventing proxy-chain spoofing from influencing client IP classification and rate-limit identity. Thanks @AnthonyDiSanti and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sandbox: remove default `--no-sandbox` for the browser container entrypoint, add explicit opt-in via `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_NO_SANDBOX` / `CLAWDBOT_BROWSER_NO_SANDBOX`, and add security-audit checks for stale/missing sandbox browser Docker hash labels. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sandbox Browser: require VNC password auth for noVNC observer sessions in the sandbox browser entrypoint, plumb per-container noVNC passwords from runtime, and emit short-lived noVNC observer token URLs while keeping loopback-only host port publishing. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox Browser: default browser sandbox containers to a dedicated Docker network (`openclaw-sandbox-browser`), add optional CDP ingress source-range restrictions, auto-create missing dedicated networks, and warn in `openclaw security --audit` when browser sandboxing runs on bridge without source-range limits. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee for reporting.

## 2026.2.19

- Dev tooling: align `oxfmt` local/CI formatting behavior. (#12579) Thanks @vincentkoc.

### Fixes

- Security: strip hidden text from `web_fetch` extracted content to prevent indirect prompt injection, covering CSS-hidden elements, class-based hiding (sr-only, d-none, etc.), invisible Unicode, color:transparent, offscreen transforms, and non-content tags. (#8027, #21074) Thanks @hydro13 for the fix and @LucasAIBuilder for reporting.
- Agents/Streaming: keep assistant partial streaming active during reasoning streams, handle native `thinking_*` stream events consistently, dedupe mixed reasoning-end signals, and clear stale mutating tool errors after same-target retry success. (#20635) Thanks @obviyus.
- iOS/Chat: use a dedicated iOS chat session key for ChatSheet routing to avoid cross-client session collisions with main-session traffic. (#21139) thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Chat: auto-resync chat history after reconnect sequence gaps, clear stale pending runs, and avoid dead-end manual refresh errors after transient disconnects. (#21135) thanks @mbelinky.
- UI/Usage: reload usage data immediately when timezone changes so Local/UTC toggles apply the selected date range without requiring a manual refresh. (#17774)
- iOS/Screen: move `WKWebView` lifecycle ownership into `ScreenWebView` coordinator and explicit attach/detach flow to reduce gesture/lifecycle crash risk (`__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:` paths) during screen tab updates. (#20366) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Onboarding: prevent pairing-status flicker during auto-resume by keeping resumed state transitions stable. (#20310) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Onboarding: stabilize pairing and reconnect behavior by resetting stale pairing request state on manual retry, disconnecting both operator and node gateways on operator failure, and avoiding duplicate pairing loops from operator transport identity attachment. (#20056) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Signing: restore local auto-selected signing-team overrides during iOS project generation by wiring `.local-signing.xcconfig` into the active signing config and emitting `OPENCLAW_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in local signing setup. (#19993) Thanks @ngutman.
- Telegram: unify message-like inbound handling so `message` and `channel_post` share the same dedupe/access/media pipeline and remain behaviorally consistent. (#20591) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: keep media-group processing resilient by skipping recoverable per-item download failures while still failing loud on non-recoverable media errors. (#20598) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram/Agents: gate exec/bash tool-failure warnings behind verbose mode so default Telegram replies stay clean while verbose sessions still surface diagnostics. (#20560) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Cron/Heartbeat: honor explicit Telegram topic targets in cron and heartbeat delivery (`<chatId>:topic:<threadId>`) so scheduled sends land in the configured topic instead of the last active thread. (#19367) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Telegram/DM routing: prevent DM inbound origin metadata from leaking into main-session `lastRoute` updates and normalize DM `lastRoute.to` to provider-prefixed `telegram:<chatId>`. (#19491) thanks @guirguispierre.
- Gateway/Daemon: forward `TMPDIR` into installed service environments so macOS LaunchAgent gateway runs can open SQLite temp/journal files reliably instead of failing with `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`. (#20512) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Agents/Billing: include the active model that produced a billing error in user-facing billing messages (for example, `OpenAI (gpt-5.3)`) across payload, failover, and lifecycle error paths, so users can identify exactly which key needs credits. (#20510) Thanks @echoVic.
- Gateway/TUI: honor `agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault` for `chat.send` by removing the hardcoded block-streaming disable override, so replies can use configured block-mode delivery. (#19693) Thanks @neipor.

- OpenClawKit/Protocol: preserve JSON boolean literals (`true`/`false`) when bridging through `AnyCodable` so Apple client RPC params no longer re-encode booleans as `1`/`0`. Thanks @mbelinky.
- Commands/Doctor: skip embedding-provider warnings when `memory.backend` is `qmd`, because QMD manages embeddings internally and does not require `memorySearch` providers. (#17263) Thanks @miloudbelarebia.
- Canvas/A2UI: improve bundled-asset resolution and empty-state handling so UI fallbacks render reliably. (#20312) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Commands/Doctor: avoid rewriting invalid configs with new `gateway.auth.token` defaults during repair and only write when real config changes are detected, preventing accidental token duplication and backup churn.
- Gateway/Auth: default unresolved gateway auth to token mode with startup auto-generation/persistence of `gateway.auth.token`, while allowing explicit `gateway.auth.mode: "none"` for intentional open loopback setups. (#20686) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Channels/Matrix: fix mention detection for `formatted_body` Matrix-to links by handling matrix.to mention formats consistently. (#16941) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Heartbeat/Cron: skip interval heartbeats when `HEARTBEAT.md` is missing or empty and no tagged cron events are queued, while preserving cron-event fallback for queued tagged reminders. (#20461) thanks @vikpos.
- Browser/Relay: reuse an already-running extension relay when the relay port is occupied by another OpenClaw process, while still failing on non-relay port collisions to avoid masking unrelated listeners. (#20035) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Scripts: update clawdock helper command support to include `docker-compose.extra.yml` where available. (#17094) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Lobster/Config: remove Lobster executable-path overrides (`lobsterPath`), require PATH-based execution, and add focused Windows wrapper-resolution tests to keep shell-free behavior stable.
- Gateway/WebChat: block `sessions.patch` and `sessions.delete` for WebChat clients so session-store mutations stay restricted to non-WebChat operator flows. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Gateway: clarify launchctl GUI domain bootstrap failure on macOS. (#13795) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Lobster/CI: fix flaky test Windows cmd shim script resolution. (#20833) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Browser/Relay: require gateway-token auth on both `/extension` and `/cdp`, and align Chrome extension setup to use a single `gateway.auth.token` input for relay authentication. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Gateway/Hooks: run BOOT.md startup checks per configured agent scope, including per-agent session-key resolution, startup-hook regression coverage, and non-success boot outcome logging for diagnosability. (#20569) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Protocol/Apple: regenerate Swift gateway models for `push.test` so `pnpm protocol:check` stays green on main. Thanks @mbelinky.
- Sandbox/Registry: serialize container and browser registry writes with shared file locks and atomic replacement to prevent lost updates and delete rollback races from desyncing `sandbox list`, `prune`, and `recreate --all`. Thanks @kexinoh.
- OTEL/diagnostics-otel: complete OpenTelemetry v2 API migration. (#12897) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Cron/Webhooks: protect cron webhook POST delivery with SSRF-guarded outbound fetch (`fetchWithSsrFGuard`) to block private/metadata destinations before request dispatch. Thanks @Adam55A-code.
- Security/Voice Call: harden `voice-call` telephony TTS override merging by blocking unsafe deep-merge keys (`__proto__`, `prototype`, `constructor`) and add regression coverage for top-level and nested prototype-pollution payloads.
- Security/Windows Daemon: harden Scheduled Task `gateway.cmd` generation by quoting cmd metacharacter arguments, escaping `%`/`!` expansions, and rejecting CR/LF in arguments, descriptions, and environment assignments (`set "KEY=VALUE"`), preventing command injection in Windows daemon startup scripts. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway/Canvas: replace shared-IP fallback auth with node-scoped session capability URLs for `/__openclaw__/canvas/*` and `/__openclaw__/a2ui/*`, fail closed when trusted-proxy requests omit forwarded client headers, and add IPv6/proxy-header regression coverage. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Net: enforce strict dotted-decimal IPv4 literals in SSRF checks and fail closed on unsupported legacy forms (octal/hex/short/packed, for example `0177.0.0.1`, `127.1`, `2130706433`) before DNS lookup.
- Security/Discord: enforce trusted-sender guild permission checks for moderation actions (`timeout`, `kick`, `ban`) and ignore untrusted `senderUserId` params to prevent privilege escalation in tool-driven flows. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/ACP+Exec: add `openclaw acp --token-file/--password-file` secret-file support (with inline secret flag warnings), redact ACP working-directory prefixes to `~` home-relative paths, constrain exec script preflight file inspection to the effective `workdir` boundary, and add security-audit warnings when `tools.exec.host="sandbox"` is configured while sandbox mode is off.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: enforce runtime/package path containment with realpath checks so `openclaw.extensions`, `openclaw.hooks`, and hook handler modules cannot escape their trusted roots via traversal or symlinks.
- Security/Discord: centralize trusted sender checks for moderation actions in message-action dispatch, share moderation command parsing across handlers, and clarify permission helpers with explicit any/all semantics.
- Security/ACP: harden ACP bridge session management with duplicate-session refresh, idle-session reaping, oldest-idle soft-cap eviction, and burst rate limiting on session creation to reduce local DoS risk without disrupting normal IDE usage.
- Security/ACP: bound ACP prompt text payloads to 2 MiB before gateway forwarding, account for join separator bytes during pre-concatenation size checks, and avoid stale active-run session state when oversized prompts are rejected. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: add optional `--pin` for npm plugin/hook installs, persist resolved npm metadata (`name`, `version`, `spec`, integrity, shasum, timestamp), warn/confirm on integrity drift during updates, and extend `openclaw security audit` to flag unpinned specs, missing integrity metadata, and install-record version drift.
- Security/Plugins: harden plugin discovery by blocking unsafe candidates (root escapes, world-writable paths, suspicious ownership), add startup warnings when `plugins.allow` is empty with discoverable non-bundled plugins, and warn on loaded plugins without install/load-path provenance.
- Security/Gateway: rate-limit control-plane write RPCs (`config.apply`, `config.patch`, `update.run`) to 3 requests per minute per `deviceId+clientIp`, add restart single-flight coalescing plus a 30-second restart cooldown, and log actor/device/ip with changed-path audit details for config/update-triggered restarts.
- Security/Webhooks: harden Feishu and Zalo webhook ingress with webhook-mode token preconditions, loopback-default Feishu bind host, JSON content-type enforcement, per-path rate limiting, replay dedupe for Zalo events, constant-time Zalo secret comparison, and anomaly status counters.
- Security/Plugins: for the next npm release, clarify plugin trust boundary and keep `runtime.system.runCommandWithTimeout` available by default for trusted in-process plugins. Thanks @markmusson for reporting.
- Security/Skills: for the next npm release, reject symlinks during skill packaging to prevent external file inclusion in distributed `.skill` archives. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: fail startup when `hooks.token` matches `gateway.auth.token` so hooks and gateway token reuse is rejected at boot. (#20813) Thanks @coygeek.
- Security/Network: block plaintext `ws://` connections to non-loopback hosts and require secure websocket transport elsewhere. (#20803) Thanks @jscaldwell55.
- Security/Config: parse frontmatter YAML using the YAML 1.2 core schema to avoid implicit coercion of `on`/`off`-style values. (#20857) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Security/Discord: escape backticks in exec-approval embed content to prevent markdown formatting injection via command text. (#20854) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Security/Agents: replace shell-based `execSync` usage with `execFileSync` in command lookup helpers to eliminate shell argument interpolation risk. (#20655) Thanks @mahanandhi.
- Security/Media: use `crypto.randomBytes()` for temp file names and set owner-only permissions for TTS temp files. (#20654) Thanks @mahanandhi.
- Security/Gateway: set baseline security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`) on gateway HTTP responses. (#10526) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/iMessage: harden remote attachment SSH/SCP handling by requiring strict host-key verification, validating `channels.imessage.remoteHost` as `host`/`user@host`, and rejecting unsafe host tokens from config or auto-detection. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Security/Feishu: prevent path traversal in Feishu inbound media temp-file writes by replacing key-derived temp filenames with UUID-based names. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Security/Feishu: escape mention regex metacharacters in `stripBotMention` so crafted mention metadata cannot trigger regex injection or ReDoS during inbound message parsing. (#20916) Thanks @orlyjamie for the fix and @allsmog for reporting.
- LINE/Security: harden inbound media temp-file naming by using UUID-based temp paths for downloaded media instead of external message IDs. (#20792) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Security/Media: harden local media ingestion against TOCTOU/symlink swap attacks by pinning reads to a single file descriptor with symlink rejection and inode/device verification in `saveMediaSource`. Thanks @dorjoos for reporting.
- Security/Lobster (Windows): for the next npm release, remove shell-based fallback when launching Lobster wrappers (`.cmd`/`.bat`) and switch to explicit argv execution with wrapper entrypoint resolution, preventing command injection while preserving Windows wrapper compatibility. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Security/Exec: require `tools.exec.safeBins` binaries to resolve from trusted bin directories (system defaults plus gateway startup `PATH`) so PATH-hijacked trojan binaries cannot bypass allowlist checks. Thanks @jackhax for reporting.
- Security/Exec: remove file-existence oracle behavior from `tools.exec.safeBins` by using deterministic argv-only stdin-safe validation and blocking file-oriented flags (for example `sort -o`, `jq -f`, `grep -f`) so allow/deny results no longer disclose host file presence. Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
- Security/Browser: route browser URL navigation through one SSRF-guarded validation path for tab-open/CDP-target/Playwright navigation flows and block private/metadata destinations by default (configurable via `browser.ssrfPolicy`). Thanks @dorjoos for reporting.
- Security/Exec: for the next npm release, harden safe-bin stdin-only enforcement by blocking output/recursive flags (`sort -o/--output`, grep recursion) and tightening default safe bins to remove `sort`/`grep`, preventing safe-bin allowlist bypass for file writes/recursive reads. Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
- Security/Exec: block grep safe-bin positional operand bypass by setting grep positional budget to zero, so `-e/--regexp` cannot smuggle bare filename reads (for example `.env`) via ambiguous positionals; safe-bin grep patterns must come from `-e/--regexp`. Thanks @athuljayaram for reporting.
- Security/Gateway/Agents: remove implicit admin scopes from agent tool gateway calls by classifying methods to least-privilege operator scopes, and enforce owner-only tooling (`cron`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) through centralized tool-policy wrappers plus tool metadata to prevent non-owner DM privilege escalation. Ships in the next npm release. Thanks @Adam55A-code for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: centralize gateway method-scope authorization and default non-CLI gateway callers to least-privilege method scopes, with explicit CLI scope handling, full core-handler scope classification coverage, and regression guards to prevent scope drift.
- Security/Net: block SSRF bypass via NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`, `64:ff9b:1::/48`), 6to4 (`2002::/16`), and Teredo (`2001:0000::/32`) IPv6 transition addresses, and fail closed on IPv6 parse errors. Thanks @jackhax.
- Security/OTEL: sanitize OTLP endpoint URL resolution. (#13791) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security: patch Dependabot security issues in pnpm lock. (#20832) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security: migrate request dependencies to `@cypress/request`. (#20836) Thanks @vincentkoc.

- Discord: add per-button `allowedUsers` allowlist for interactive components to restrict who can click buttons. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Cron/Gateway: separate per-job webhook delivery (`delivery.mode = "webhook"`) from announce delivery, enforce valid HTTP(S) webhook URLs, and keep a temporary legacy `notify + cron.webhook` fallback for stored jobs. (#17901) Thanks @advaitpaliwal.
- Cron/CLI: add deterministic default stagger for recurring top-of-hour cron schedules (including 6-field seconds cron), auto-migrate existing jobs to persisted `schedule.staggerMs`, and add `openclaw cron add/edit --stagger <duration>` plus `--exact` overrides for per-job timing control.
- Cron: log per-run model/provider usage telemetry in cron run logs/webhooks and add a local usage report script for aggregating token usage by job. (#18172) Thanks @HankAndTheCrew.
- Tools/Web: add URL allowlists for `web_search` and `web_fetch`. (#18584) Thanks @smartprogrammer93.

- Auto-reply/Prompts: include trusted inbound `message_id` in conversation metadata payloads for downstream targeting workflows. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Auto-reply: include `sender_id` in trusted inbound metadata so moderation workflows can target the sender without relying on untrusted text. (#18303) Thanks @crimeacs.
- UI/Sessions: avoid duplicating typed session prefixes in display names (for example `Subagent Subagent ...`). Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Z.AI: enable `tool_stream` by default for real-time tool call streaming, with opt-out via `params.tool_stream: false`. (#18173) Thanks @tianxiao1430-jpg.

### Fixes

- Agents/Antigravity: preserve unsigned Claude thinking blocks as plain text instead of dropping them during transcript sanitization, preventing reasoning context loss while avoiding `thinking.signature` request rejections.
- Agents/Google: clean tool JSON Schemas for `google-antigravity` the same as `google-gemini-cli` before Cloud Code Assist requests, preventing Claude tool calls from failing with `patternProperties` 400 errors. (#19860)
- Tests/Telegram: add regression coverage for command-menu sync that asserts all `setMyCommands` entries are Telegram-safe and hyphen-normalized across native/custom/plugin command sources. (#19703) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Image: collapse resize diagnostics to one line per image and include visible pixel/byte size details in the log message for faster triage.
- Auth/Cooldowns: clear all usage stats fields (`disabledUntil`, `disabledReason`, `failureCounts`) in `clearAuthProfileCooldown` so manual cooldown resets fully recover billing-disabled profiles without requiring direct file edits. (#19211) Thanks @nabbilkhan.
- Agents/Subagents: preemptively guard accumulated tool-result context before model calls by truncating oversized outputs and compacting oldest tool-result messages to avoid context-window overflow crashes. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Subagents/CLI: fail `sessions_spawn` when subagent model patching is rejected, allow subagent model patch defaults from `subagents.model`, and keep `sessions list`/`status` model reporting aligned to runtime model resolution. (#18660) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents/Subagents: add explicit subagent guidance to recover from `[compacted: tool output removed to free context]` / `[truncated: output exceeded context limit]` markers by re-reading with smaller chunks instead of full-file `cat`. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: make `read` auto-page across chunks (when no explicit `limit` is provided) and scale its per-call output budget from model `contextWindow`, so larger contexts can read more before context guards kick in. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: strip duplicated `read` truncation payloads from tool-result `details` and make pre-call context guarding account for heavy tool-result metadata, so repeated `read` calls no longer bypass compaction and overflow model context windows. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Reply threading: keep reply context sticky across streamed/split chunks and preserve `replyToId` on all chunk sends across shared and channel-specific delivery paths (including iMessage, BlueBubbles, Telegram, Discord, and Matrix), so follow-up bubbles stay attached to the same referenced message. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Gateway/Agent: defer transient lifecycle `error` snapshots with a short grace window so `agent.wait` does not resolve early during retry/failover. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Gateway/Presence: centralize presence snapshot broadcasts and unify runtime version precedence (`OPENCLAW_VERSION` > `OPENCLAW_SERVICE_VERSION` > `npm_package_version`) so self-presence and websocket `hello-ok` report consistent versions.
- Hooks/Automation: bridge outbound/inbound message lifecycle into internal hook events (`message:received`, `message:sent`) with session-key correlation guards, while keeping per-payload success/error reporting accurate for chunked and best-effort deliveries. (PR #9387)
- Media understanding: honor `agents.defaults.imageModel` during auto-discovery so implicit image analysis uses configured primary/fallback image models. (PR #7607)
- iOS/Onboarding: stop auth Step 3 retry-loop churn by pausing reconnect attempts on unauthorized/missing-token gateway errors and keeping auth/pairing issue state sticky during manual retry. (#19153) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Voice-call: auto-end calls when media streams disconnect to prevent stuck active calls. (#18435) Thanks @JayMishra-source.
- Voice call/Gateway: prevent overlapping closed-loop turn races with per-call turn locking, route transcript dedupe via source-aware fingerprints with strict cache eviction bounds, and harden `voicecall latency` stats for large logs without spread-operator stack overflow. (#19140) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Chat: route ChatSheet RPCs through the operator session instead of the node session to avoid node-role authorization failures for `chat.history`, `chat.send`, and `sessions.list`. (#19320) Thanks @mbelinky.
- macOS/Update: correct the Sparkle appcast version for 2026.2.15 so updates are offered again. (#18201)

- Fix types in all tests. Typecheck the whole repository.
- Gateway/Channels: wire `gateway.channelHealthCheckMinutes` into strict config validation, treat implicit account status as managed for health checks, and harden channel auto-restart flow (preserve restart-attempt caps across crash loops, propagate enabled/configured runtime flags, and stop pending restart backoff after manual stop). Thanks @steipete.
- Gateway/WebChat: hard-cap `chat.history` oversized payloads by truncating high-cost fields and replacing over-budget entries with placeholders, so history fetches stay within configured byte limits and avoid chat UI freezes. (#18505)
- UI/Usage: replace lingering undefined `var(--text-muted)` usage with `var(--muted)` in usage date-range and chart styles to keep muted text visible across themes. (#17975) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Usage: preserve selected-range totals when timeline data is downsampled by bucket-aggregating timeseries points (instead of dropping intermediate points), so filtered tokens/cost stay accurate. (#17959) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Sessions: refresh the sessions table only after successful deletes and preserve delete errors on cancel/failure paths, so deleted sessions disappear automatically without masking delete failures. (#18507)
- Scripts/UI/Windows: fix `pnpm ui:*` spawn `EINVAL` failures by restoring shell-backed launch for `.cmd`/`.bat` runners, narrowing shell usage to launcher types that require it, and rejecting unsafe forwarded shell metacharacters in UI script args. (#18594)
- Hooks/Session-memory: recover `/new` conversation summaries when session pointers are reset-path or missing `sessionFile`, and consistently prefer the newest `.jsonl.reset.*` transcript candidate for fallback extraction. (#18088)
- Auto-reply/Sessions: prevent stale thread ID leakage into non-thread sessions so replies stay in the main DM after topic interactions. (#18528) Thanks @j2h4u.
- Slack: restrict forwarded-attachment ingestion to explicit shared-message attachments and skip non-Slack forwarded `image_url` fetches, preventing non-forward attachment unfurls from polluting inbound agent context while preserving forwarded message handling.
- Feishu: detect bot mentions in post messages with embedded docs when `message.mentions` is empty. (#18074) Thanks @popomore.
- Agents/Sessions: align session lock watchdog hold windows with run and compaction timeout budgets (plus grace), preventing valid long-running turns from being force-unlocked mid-run while still recovering hung lock owners. (#18060)
- Cron: preserve default model fallbacks for cron agent runs when only `model.primary` is overridden, so failover still follows configured fallbacks unless explicitly cleared with `fallbacks: []`. (#18210) Thanks @mahsumaktas.
- Cron: route text-only announce output through the main session announce flow via runSubagentAnnounceFlow so cron text-only output remains visible to the initiating session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron: treat `timeoutSeconds: 0` as no-timeout (not clamped to 1), ensuring long-running cron runs are not prematurely terminated. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron announce injection now targets the session determined by delivery config (`to` + channel) instead of defaulting to the current session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron/Heartbeat: canonicalize session-scoped reminder `sessionKey` routing and preserve explicit flat `sessionKey` cron tool inputs, preventing enqueue/wake namespace drift for session-targeted reminders. (#18637) Thanks @vignesh07.
- Cron/Webhooks: reuse existing session IDs for webhook/cron runs when the session key is stable and still fresh, preserving conversation history. (#18031) Thanks @Operative-001.
- Cron: prevent spin loops when cron jobs complete within the scheduled second by advancing the next run and enforcing a minimum refire gap. (#18073) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.

- iOS/Gateway: stabilize connect/discovery state handling, add onboarding reset recovery in Settings, and fix iOS gateway-controller coverage for command-surface and last-connection persistence behavior. (#18164) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Talk: harden mobile talk config handling by ignoring redacted/env-placeholder API keys, support secure local keychain override, improve accessibility motion/contrast behavior in status UI, and tighten ATS to local-network allowance. (#18163) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Location: restore the significant location monitor implementation (service hooks + protocol surface + ATS key alignment) after merge drift so iOS builds compile again. (#18260) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Signing: auto-select local Apple Development team during iOS project generation/build, prefer the canonical OpenClaw team when available, and support local per-machine signing overrides without committing team IDs. (#18421) Thanks @ngutman.
- Discord/Telegram: make per-account message action gates effective for both action listing and execution, and preserve top-level gate restrictions when account overrides only specify a subset of `actions` keys (account key -> base key -> default fallback). (#18494)
- Telegram: keep DM-topic replies and draft previews in the originating private-chat topic by preserving positive `message_thread_id` values for DM threads. (#18586) Thanks @sebslight.
- Telegram: preserve private-chat topic `message_thread_id` on outbound sends (message/sticker/poll), keep thread-not-found retry fallback, and avoid masking `chat not found` routing errors. (#18993) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord: prevent duplicate media delivery when the model uses the `message send` tool with media, by skipping media extraction from messaging tool results since the tool already sent the message directly. (#18270)
- Discord: route `audioAsVoice` auto-replies through the voice message API so opt-in audio renders as voice messages. (#18041) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Discord: skip auto-thread creation in forum/media/voice/stage channels and keep group session last-route metadata fresh to avoid invalid thread API errors and lost follow-up sends. (#18098) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Discord/Commands: normalize `commands.allowFrom` entries with `user:`/`discord:`/`pk:` prefixes and `<@id>` mentions so command authorization matches Discord allowlist behavior. (#18042)

- Telegram: debounce the first draft-stream preview update (30-char threshold) and finalize short responses by editing the stop-time preview message, improving first push notifications and avoiding duplicate final sends. (#18148) Thanks @Marvae.
- Telegram: disable block streaming when `channels.telegram.streamMode` is `off`, preventing newline/content-block replies from splitting into multiple messages. (#17679) Thanks @saivarunk.
- Telegram: keep `streamMode: "partial"` draft previews in a single message across assistant-message/reasoning boundaries, preventing duplicate preview bubbles during partial-mode tool-call turns. (#18956) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: normalize native command names for Telegram menu registration (`-` -> `_`) to avoid `BOT_COMMAND_INVALID` command-menu wipeouts, and log failed command syncs instead of silently swallowing them. (#19257) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Telegram: route non-abort slash commands on the normal chat/topic sequential lane while keeping true abort requests (`/stop`, `stop`) on the control lane, preventing command/reply race conditions from control-lane bypass. (#17899) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: ignore `<media:...>` placeholder lines when extracting `MEDIA:` tool-result paths, preventing false local-file reads and dropped replies. (#18510) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: skip retries when inbound media `getFile` fails with Telegram's 20MB limit and continue processing message text, avoiding dropped messages for oversized attachments. (#18531) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Telegram: clear stored polling offsets when bot tokens change or accounts are deleted, preventing stale offsets after token rotations. (#18233)
- Telegram: enable `autoSelectFamily` by default on Node.js 22+ so IPv4 fallback works on broken IPv6 networks. (#18272) Thanks @nacho9900.
- Auto-reply/TTS: keep tool-result media delivery enabled in group chats and native command sessions (while still suppressing tool summary text) so `NO_REPLY` follow-ups do not drop successful TTS audio. (#17991) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Agents/Tools: deliver tool-result media even when verbose tool output is off so media attachments are not dropped. (#16679)
- Discord: optimize reaction notification handling to skip unnecessary message fetches in `off`/`all`/`allowlist` modes, streamline reaction routing, and improve reaction emoji formatting. (#18248) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow and @victorGPT.
- CLI/Pairing: make `openclaw qr --remote` prefer `gateway.remote.url` over tailscale/public URL resolution and register the `openclaw clawbot qr` legacy alias path. (#18091)
- CLI/QR: restore fail-fast validation for `openclaw qr --remote` when neither `gateway.remote.url` nor tailscale `serve`/`funnel` is configured, preventing unusable remote pairing QR flows. (#18166) Thanks @mbelinky.
- CLI: fix parent/subcommand option collisions across gateway, daemon, update, ACP, and browser command flows, while preserving legacy `browser set headers --json <payload>` compatibility.
- CLI/Doctor: ensure `openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive --yes` exits promptly after completion so one-shot automation no longer hangs. (#18502)
- CLI/Doctor: auto-repair `dmPolicy="open"` configs missing wildcard allowlists and write channel-correct repair paths (including `channels.googlechat.dm.allowFrom`) so `openclaw doctor --fix` no longer leaves Google Chat configs invalid after attempted repair. (#18544)
- CLI/Doctor: detect gateway service token drift when the gateway token is only provided via environment variables, keeping service repairs aligned after token rotation.
- Gateway/Update: prevent restart crash loops after failed self-updates by restarting only on successful updates, stopping early on failed install/build steps, and running `openclaw doctor --fix` during updates to sanitize config. (#18131) Thanks @RamiNoodle733.
- Gateway/Update: preserve update.run restart delivery context so post-update status replies route back to the initiating channel/thread. (#18267) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- CLI/Update: run a standalone restart helper after updates, honoring service-name overrides and reporting restart initiation separately from confirmed restarts. (#18050)
- CLI/Daemon: warn when a gateway restart sees a stale service token so users can reinstall with `openclaw gateway install --force`, and skip drift warnings for non-gateway service restarts. (#18018)
- CLI/Daemon: prefer the active version-manager Node when installing daemons and include macOS version-manager bin directories in the service PATH so launchd services resolve user-managed runtimes.
- CLI/Status: fix `openclaw status --all` token summaries for bot-token-only channels so Mattermost/Zalo no longer show a bot+app warning. (#18527) Thanks @echo931.
- CLI/Configure: make the `/model picker` allowlist prompt searchable with tokenized matching in `openclaw configure` so users can filter huge model lists by typing terms like `gpt-5.2 openai/`. (#19010) Thanks @bjesuiter.
- CLI/Message: preserve `--components` JSON payloads in `openclaw message send` so Discord component payloads are no longer dropped. (#18222) Thanks @saurabhchopade.
- Voice Call: add an optional stale call reaper (`staleCallReaperSeconds`) to end stuck calls when enabled. (#18437)
- Auto-reply/Subagents: propagate group context (`groupId`, `groupChannel`, `space`) when spawning via `/subagents spawn`, matching tool-triggered subagent spawn behavior.
- Subagents: route nested announce results back to the parent session after the parent run ends, falling back only when the parent session is deleted. (#18043) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Subagents: cap announce retry loops with max attempts and expiry to prevent infinite retry spam after deferred announces. (#18444)
- Agents/Tools/exec: add a preflight guard that detects likely shell env var injection (e.g. `$DM_JSON`, `$TMPDIR`) in Python/Node scripts before execution, preventing recurring cron failures and wasted tokens when models emit mixed shell+language source. (#12836)
- Agents/Tools/exec: treat normal non-zero exit codes as completed and append the exit code to tool output to avoid false tool-failure warnings. (#18425)
- Agents/Tools: make loop detection progress-aware and phased by hard-blocking known `process(action=poll|log)` no-progress loops, warning on generic identical-call repeats, warning + no-progress-blocking ping-pong alternation loops (10/20), coalescing repeated warning spam into threshold buckets (including canonical ping-pong pairs), adding a global circuit breaker at 30 no-progress repeats, and emitting structured diagnostic `tool.loop` warning/error events for loop actions. (#16808) Thanks @akramcodez and @beca-oc.
- Agents/Hooks: preserve the `before_tool_call` wrapped-marker across abort-signal tool wrapping so the hook runs once per tool call in normal agent sessions. (#16852) Thanks @sreuter.
- Agents/Tests: add `before_message_write` persistence regression coverage for block/mutate behavior (including synthetic tool-result flushes) and thrown-hook fallback persistence. (#18197) Thanks @shakkernerd
- Agents/Tools: scope the `message` tool schema to the active channel so Telegram uses `buttons` and Discord uses `components`. (#18215) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Image tool: replace Anthropic-incompatible union schema with explicit `image` (single) and `images` (multi) parameters, keeping tool schemas `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`-free while preserving multi-image analysis support. (#18551, #18566) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Agents/Models: probe the primary model when its auth-profile cooldown is near expiry (with per-provider throttling), so runs recover from temporary rate limits without staying on fallback models until restart. (#17478) Thanks @PlayerGhost.
- Agents/Failover: classify provider abort stop-reason errors (`Unhandled stop reason: abort`, `stop reason: abort`, `reason: abort`) as timeout-class failures so configured model fallback chains trigger instead of surfacing raw abort failures. (#18618) Thanks @sauerdaniel.
- Models/CLI: sync auth-profiles credentials into agent `auth.json` before registry availability checks so `openclaw models list --all` reports auth correctly for API-key/token providers, normalize provider-id aliases when bridging credentials, and skip expired token mirrors. (#18610, #18615)
- Agents/Context: raise default total bootstrap prompt cap from `24000` to `150000` chars (keeping `bootstrapMaxChars` at `20000`), include total-cap visibility in `/context`, and mark truncation from injected-vs-raw sizes so total-cap clipping is reflected accurately.
- Memory/QMD: scope managed collection names per agent and precreate glob-backed collection directories before registration, preventing cross-agent collection clobbering and startup ENOENT failures in fresh workspaces. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Cron: preserve per-job schedule-error isolation in post-run maintenance recompute so malformed sibling jobs no longer abort persistence of successful runs. (#17852) Thanks @pierreeurope.
- Gateway/Config: prevent `config.patch` object-array merges from falling back to full-array replacement when some patch entries lack `id`, so partial `agents.list` updates no longer drop unrelated agents. (#17989) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Gateway/Auth: trim whitespace around trusted proxy entries before matching so configured proxies with stray spaces still authorize. (#18084) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Config/Discord: require string IDs in Discord allowlists, keep onboarding inputs string-only, and add doctor repair for numeric entries. (#18220) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Sessions: create new session transcript JSONL files with user-only (`0o600`) permissions and extend `openclaw security audit --fix` to remediate existing transcript file permissions.
- Sessions/Maintenance: archive transcripts when pruning stale sessions, clean expired media in subdirectories, and purge `.deleted` transcript archives after the prune window to prevent disk leaks. (#18538)
- Infra/Fetch: ensure foreign abort-signal listener cleanup never masks original fetch successes/failures, while still preventing detached-finally unhandled rejection noise in `wrapFetchWithAbortSignal`. Thanks @Jackten.
- Heartbeat: allow suppressing tool error warning payloads during heartbeat runs via a new heartbeat config flag. (#18497) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Heartbeat: include sender metadata (From/To/Provider) in heartbeat prompts so model context matches the delivery target. (#18532) Thanks @dinakars777.
- Heartbeat/Telegram: strip configured `responsePrefix` before heartbeat ack detection (with boundary-safe matching) so prefixed `HEARTBEAT_OK` replies are correctly suppressed instead of leaking into DMs. (#18602)

## 2026.2.15

### Changes

- Discord: unlock rich interactive agent prompts with Components v2 (buttons, selects, modals, and attachment-backed file blocks) so for native interaction through Discord. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: components v2 UI + embeds passthrough + exec approval UX refinements (CV2 containers, button layout, Discord-forwarding skip). Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Plugins: expose `llm_input` and `llm_output` hook payloads so extensions can observe prompt/input context and model output usage details. (#16724) Thanks @SecondThread.
- Subagents: nested sub-agents (sub-sub-agents) with configurable depth. Set `agents.defaults.subagents.maxSpawnDepth: 2` to allow sub-agents to spawn their own children. Includes `maxChildrenPerAgent` limit (default 5), depth-aware tool policy, and proper announce chain routing. (#14447) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Slack/Discord/Telegram: add per-channel ack reaction overrides (account/channel-level) to support platform-specific emoji formats. (#17092) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Telegram: add `channel_post` inbound support for channel-based bot-to-bot wake/trigger flows, with channel allowlist gating and message/media batching parity.
- Cron/Gateway: add finished-run webhook delivery toggle (`notify`) and dedicated webhook auth token support (`cron.webhookToken`) for outbound cron webhook posts. (#14535) Thanks @advaitpaliwal.
- Channels: deduplicate probe/token resolution base types across core + extensions while preserving per-channel error typing. (#16986) Thanks @iyoda and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Memory: add MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) re-ranking for hybrid search diversity. Configurable via `memorySearch.query.hybrid.mmr`. Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Memory: add opt-in temporal decay for hybrid search scoring, with configurable half-life via `memorySearch.query.hybrid.temporalDecay`. Thanks @rodrigouroz.

### Fixes

- Discord: send initial content when creating non-forum threads so `thread-create` content is delivered. (#18117) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Security: replace deprecated SHA-1 sandbox configuration hashing with SHA-256 for deterministic sandbox cache identity and recreation checks. Thanks @kexinoh.
- Security/Logging: redact Telegram bot tokens from error messages and uncaught stack traces to prevent accidental secret leakage into logs. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Sandbox/Security: block dangerous sandbox Docker config (bind mounts, host networking, unconfined seccomp/apparmor) to prevent container escape via config injection. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Sandbox: preserve array order in config hashing so order-sensitive Docker/browser settings trigger container recreation correctly. Thanks @kexinoh.
- Gateway/Security: redact sensitive session/path details from `status` responses for non-admin clients; full details remain available to `operator.admin`. (#8590) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Gateway/Control UI: preserve requested operator scopes for Control UI bypass modes (`allowInsecureAuth` / `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth`) when device identity is unavailable, preventing false `missing scope` failures on authenticated LAN/HTTP operator sessions. (#17682) Thanks @leafbird.
- LINE/Security: fail closed on webhook startup when channel token or channel secret is missing, and treat LINE accounts as configured only when both are present. (#17587) Thanks @davidahmann.
- Skills/Security: restrict `download` installer `targetDir` to the per-skill tools directory to prevent arbitrary file writes. Thanks @Adam55A-code.
- Skills/Linux: harden go installer fallback on apt-based systems by handling root/no-sudo environments safely, doing best-effort apt index refresh, and returning actionable errors instead of failing with spawn errors. (#17687) Thanks @mcrolly.
- Web Fetch/Security: cap downloaded response body size before HTML parsing to prevent memory exhaustion from oversized or deeply nested pages. Thanks @xuemian168.
- Config/Gateway: make sensitive-key whitelist suffix matching case-insensitive while preserving `passwordFile` path exemptions, preventing accidental redaction of non-secret config values like `maxTokens` and IRC password-file paths. (#16042) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Dev tooling: harden git `pre-commit` hook against option injection from malicious filenames (for example `--force`), preventing accidental staging of ignored files. Thanks @mrthankyou.
- Gateway/Agent: reject malformed `agent:`-prefixed session keys (for example, `agent:main`) in `agent` and `agent.identity.get` instead of silently resolving them to the default agent, preventing accidental cross-session routing. (#15707) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/Chat: harden `chat.send` inbound message handling by rejecting null bytes, stripping unsafe control characters, and normalizing Unicode to NFC before dispatch. (#8593) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Gateway/Send: return an actionable error when `send` targets internal-only `webchat`, guiding callers to use `chat.send` or a deliverable channel. (#15703) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/Commands: keep webchat command authorization on the internal `webchat` context instead of inferring another provider from channel allowlists, fixing dropped `/new`/`/status` commands in Control UI when channel allowlists are configured. (#7189) Thanks @karlisbergmanis-lv.
- Control UI: prevent stored XSS via assistant name/avatar by removing inline script injection, serving bootstrap config as JSON, and enforcing `script-src 'self'`. Thanks @Adam55A-code.
- Agents/Security: sanitize workspace paths before embedding into LLM prompts (strip Unicode control/format chars) to prevent instruction injection via malicious directory names. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Agents/Sandbox: clarify system prompt path guidance so sandbox `bash/exec` uses container paths (for example `/workspace`) while file tools keep host-bridge mapping, avoiding first-attempt path misses from host-only absolute paths in sandbox command execution. (#17693) Thanks @app/juniordevbot.
- Agents/Context: apply configured model `contextWindow` overrides after provider discovery so `lookupContextTokens()` honors operator config values (including discovery-failure paths). (#17404) Thanks @michaelbship and @vignesh07.
- Agents/Context: derive `lookupContextTokens()` from auth-available model metadata and keep the smallest discovered context window for duplicate model ids, preventing cross-provider cache collisions from overestimating session context limits. (#17586) Thanks @githabideri and @vignesh07.
- Agents/OpenAI: force `store=true` for direct OpenAI Responses/Codex runs to preserve multi-turn server-side conversation state, while leaving proxy/non-OpenAI endpoints unchanged. (#16803) Thanks @mark9232 and @vignesh07.
- Memory/FTS: make `buildFtsQuery` Unicode-aware so non-ASCII queries (including CJK) produce keyword tokens instead of falling back to vector-only search. (#17672) Thanks @KinGP5471.
- Auto-reply/Compaction: resolve `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` placeholders with timezone-aware runtime dates and append a `Current time:` line to memory-flush turns, preventing wrong-year memory filenames without making the system prompt time-variant. (#17603, #17633) Thanks @nicholaspapadam-wq and @vignesh07.
- Auth/Cooldowns: auto-expire stale auth profile cooldowns when `cooldownUntil` or `disabledUntil` timestamps have passed, and reset `errorCount` so the next transient failure does not immediately escalate to a disproportionately long cooldown. Handles `cooldownUntil` and `disabledUntil` independently. (#3604) Thanks @nabbilkhan.
- Agents: return an explicit timeout error reply when an embedded run times out before producing any payloads, preventing silent dropped turns during slow cache-refresh transitions. (#16659) Thanks @liaosvcaf and @vignesh07.
- Group chats: always inject group chat context (name, participants, reply guidance) into the system prompt on every turn, not just the first. Prevents the model from losing awareness of which group it's in and incorrectly using the message tool to send to the same group. (#14447) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Browser/Agents: when browser control service is unavailable, return explicit non-retry guidance (instead of "try again") so models do not loop on repeated browser tool calls until timeout. (#17673) Thanks @austenstone.
- Subagents: use child-run-based deterministic announce idempotency keys across direct and queued delivery paths (with legacy queued-item fallback) to prevent duplicate announce retries without collapsing distinct same-millisecond announces. (#17150) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Subagents/Models: preserve `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` when subagent sessions carry a model override, so subagent runs fail over to configured fallback models instead of retrying only the overridden primary model.
- Agents/Tools: scope the `message` tool schema to the active channel so Telegram uses `buttons` and Discord uses `components`. (#18215) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: omit `message_thread_id` for DM sends/draft previews and keep forum-topic handling (`id=1` general omitted, non-general kept), preventing DM failures with `400 Bad Request: message thread not found`. (#10942) Thanks @garnetlyx.
- Telegram: replace inbound `<media:audio>` placeholder with successful preflight voice transcript in message body context, preventing placeholder-only prompt bodies for mention-gated voice messages. (#16789) Thanks @Limitless2023.
- Telegram: retry inbound media `getFile` calls (3 attempts with backoff) and gracefully fall back to placeholder-only processing when retries fail, preventing dropped voice/media messages on transient Telegram network errors. (#16154) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: finalize streaming preview replies in place instead of sending a second final message, preventing duplicate Telegram assistant outputs at stream completion. (#17218) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord: preserve channel session continuity when runtime payloads omit `message.channelId` by falling back to event/raw `channel_id` values for routing/session keys, so same-channel messages keep history across turns/restarts. Also align diagnostics so active Discord runs no longer appear as `sessionKey=unknown`. (#17622) Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Discord: dedupe native skill commands by skill name in multi-agent setups to prevent duplicated slash commands with `_2` suffixes. (#17365) Thanks @seewhyme.
- Discord: ensure role allowlist matching uses raw role IDs for message routing authorization. Thanks @xinhuagu.
- Discord: skip text-based exec approval forwarding in favor of Discord's component-based approval UI. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Web UI/Agents: hide `BOOTSTRAP.md` in the Agents Files list after onboarding is completed, avoiding confusing missing-file warnings for completed workspaces. (#17491) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Memory/QMD: scope managed collection names per agent and precreate glob-backed collection directories before registration, preventing cross-agent collection clobbering and startup ENOENT failures in fresh workspaces. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Gateway/Memory: initialize QMD startup sync for every configured agent (not just the default agent), so `memory.qmd.update.onBoot` is effective across multi-agent setups. (#17663) Thanks @HenryLoenwind.
- Auto-reply/WhatsApp/TUI/Web: when a final assistant message is `NO_REPLY` and a messaging tool send succeeded, mirror the delivered messaging-tool text into session-visible assistant output so TUI/Web no longer show `NO_REPLY` placeholders. (#7010) Thanks @Morrowind-Xie.
- Cron: infer `payload.kind="agentTurn"` for model-only `cron.update` payload patches, so partial agent-turn updates do not fail validation when `kind` is omitted. (#15664) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- TUI: make searchable-select filtering and highlight rendering ANSI-aware so queries ignore hidden escape codes and no longer corrupt ANSI styling sequences during match highlighting. (#4519) Thanks @bee4come.
- TUI/Windows: coalesce rapid single-line submit bursts in Git Bash into one multiline message as a fallback when bracketed paste is unavailable, preventing pasted multiline text from being split into multiple sends. (#4986) Thanks @adamkane.
- TUI: suppress false `(no output)` placeholders for non-local empty final events during concurrent runs, preventing external-channel replies from showing empty assistant bubbles while a local run is still streaming. (#5782) Thanks @LagWizard and @vignesh07.
- TUI: preserve copy-sensitive long tokens (URLs/paths/file-like identifiers) during wrapping and overflow sanitization so wrapped output no longer inserts spaces that corrupt copy/paste values. (#17515, #17466, #17505) Thanks @abe238, @trevorpan, and @JasonCry.
- CLI/Build: make legacy daemon CLI compatibility shim generation tolerant of minimal tsdown daemon export sets, while preserving restart/register compatibility aliases and surfacing explicit errors for unavailable legacy daemon commands. Thanks @vignesh07.

## 2026.2.14

### Changes

- Telegram: add poll sending via `openclaw message poll` (duration seconds, silent delivery, anonymity controls). (#16209) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Slack/Discord: add `dmPolicy` + `allowFrom` config aliases for DM access control; legacy `dm.policy` + `dm.allowFrom` keys remain supported and `openclaw doctor --fix` can migrate them.
- Discord: allow exec approval prompts to target channels or both DM+channel via `channels.discord.execApprovals.target`. (#16051) Thanks @leonnardo.
- Sandbox: add `sandbox.browser.binds` to configure browser-container bind mounts separately from exec containers. (#16230) Thanks @seheepeak.
- Discord: add debug logging for message routing decisions to improve `--debug` tracing. (#16202) Thanks @jayleekr.
- Agents: add optional `messages.suppressToolErrors` config to hide non-mutating tool-failure warnings from user-facing chat while still surfacing mutating failures. (#16620) Thanks @vai-oro.

### Fixes

- CLI/Installation: fix Docker installation hangs on macOS. (#12972) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Models: fix antigravity opus 4.6 availability follow-up. (#12845) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sessions/Telegram: restrict session tool targeting by default to the current session tree (`tools.sessions.visibility`, default `tree`) with sandbox clamping, and pass configured per-account Telegram webhook secrets in webhook mode when no explicit override is provided. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- CLI/Plugins: ensure `openclaw message send` exits after successful delivery across plugin-backed channels so one-shot sends do not hang. (#16491) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- CLI/Plugins: run registered plugin `gateway_stop` hooks before `openclaw message` exits (success and failure paths), so plugin-backed channels can clean up one-shot CLI resources. (#16580) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- WhatsApp: honor per-account `dmPolicy` overrides (account-level settings now take precedence over channel defaults for inbound DMs). (#10082) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram: when `channels.telegram.commands.native` is `false`, exclude plugin commands from `setMyCommands` menu registration while keeping plugin slash handlers callable. (#15132) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- LINE: return 200 OK for Developers Console "Verify" requests (`{"events":[]}`) without `X-Line-Signature`, while still requiring signatures for real deliveries. (#16582) Thanks @arosstale.
- Cron: deliver text-only output directly when `delivery.to` is set so cron recipients get full output instead of summaries. (#16360) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Cron/Slack: preserve agent identity (name and icon) when cron jobs deliver outbound messages. (#16242) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Media: accept `MEDIA:`-prefixed paths (lenient whitespace) when loading outbound media to prevent `ENOENT` for tool-returned local media paths. (#13107) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Media understanding: treat binary `application/vnd.*`/zip/octet-stream attachments as non-text (while keeping vendor `+json`/`+xml` text-eligible) so Office/ZIP files are not inlined into prompt body text. (#16513) Thanks @rmramsey32.
- Agents: deliver tool result media (screenshots, images, audio) to channels regardless of verbose level. (#11735) Thanks @strelov1.
- Auto-reply/Block streaming: strip leading whitespace from streamed block replies so messages starting with blank lines no longer deliver visible leading empty lines. (#16422) Thanks @mcinteerj.
- Auto-reply/Queue: keep queued followups and overflow summaries when drain attempts fail, then retry delivery instead of dropping messages on transient errors. (#16771) Thanks @mmhzlrj.
- Agents/Image tool: allow workspace-local image paths by including the active workspace directory in local media allowlists, and trust sandbox-validated paths in image loaders to prevent false "not under an allowed directory" rejections. (#15541)
- Agents/Image tool: propagate the effective workspace root into tool wiring so workspace-local image paths are accepted by default when running without an explicit `workspaceDir`. (#16722)
- BlueBubbles: include sender identity in group chat envelopes and pass clean message text to the agent prompt, aligning with iMessage/Signal formatting. (#16210) Thanks @zerone0x.
- CLI: fix lazy core command registration so top-level maintenance commands (`doctor`, `dashboard`, `reset`, `uninstall`) resolve correctly instead of exposing a non-functional `maintenance` placeholder command.
- CLI/Dashboard: when `gateway.bind=lan`, generate localhost dashboard URLs to satisfy browser secure-context requirements while preserving non-LAN bind behavior. (#16434) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- TUI/Gateway: resolve local gateway target URL from `gateway.bind` mode (tailnet/lan) instead of hardcoded localhost so `openclaw tui` connects when gateway is non-loopback. (#16299) Thanks @cortexuvula.
- TUI: honor explicit `--session <key>` in `openclaw tui` even when `session.scope` is `global`, so named sessions no longer collapse into shared global history. (#16575) Thanks @cinqu.
- TUI: use available terminal width for session name display in searchable select lists. (#16238) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- TUI: preserve in-flight streaming replies when a different run finalizes concurrently (avoid clearing active run or reloading history mid-stream). (#10704) Thanks @axschr73.
- TUI: keep pre-tool streamed text visible when later tool-boundary deltas temporarily omit earlier text blocks. (#6958) Thanks @KrisKind75.
- TUI: sanitize ANSI/control-heavy history text, redact binary-like lines, and split pathological long unbroken tokens before rendering to prevent startup crashes on binary attachment history. (#13007) Thanks @wilkinspoe.
- TUI: harden render-time sanitizer for narrow terminals by chunking moderately long unbroken tokens and adding fast-path sanitization guards to reduce overhead on normal text. (#5355) Thanks @tingxueren.
- TUI: render assistant body text in terminal default foreground (instead of fixed light ANSI color) so contrast remains readable on light themes such as Solarized Light. (#16750) Thanks @paymog.
- TUI/Hooks: pass explicit reset reason (`new` vs `reset`) through `sessions.reset` and emit internal command hooks for gateway-triggered resets so `/new` hook workflows fire in TUI/webchat.
- Gateway/Agent: route bare `/new` and `/reset` through `sessions.reset` before running the fresh-session greeting prompt, so reset commands clear the current session in-place instead of falling through to normal agent runs. (#16732) Thanks @kdotndot and @vignesh07.
- Cron: prevent `cron list`/`cron status` from silently skipping past-due recurring jobs by using maintenance recompute semantics. (#16156) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Cron: repair missing/corrupt `nextRunAtMs` for the updated job without globally recomputing unrelated due jobs during `cron update`. (#15750)
- Cron: treat persisted jobs with missing `enabled` as enabled by default across update/list/timer due-path checks, and add regression coverage for missing-`enabled` store records. (#15433) Thanks @eternauta1337.
- Cron: skip missed-job replay on startup for jobs interrupted mid-run (stale `runningAtMs` markers), preventing restart loops for self-restarting jobs such as update tasks. (#16694) Thanks @sbmilburn.
- Heartbeat/Cron: treat cron-tagged queued system events as cron reminders even on interval wakes, so isolated cron announce summaries no longer run under the default heartbeat prompt. (#14947) Thanks @archedark-ada and @vignesh07.
- Discord: prefer gateway guild id when logging inbound messages so cached-miss guilds do not appear as `guild=dm`. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: treat empty per-guild `channels: {}` config maps as no channel allowlist (not deny-all), so `groupPolicy: "open"` guilds without explicit channel entries continue to receive messages. (#16714) Thanks @xqliu.
- Models/CLI: guard `models status` string trimming paths to prevent crashes from malformed non-string config values. (#16395) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Gateway/Subagents: preserve queued announce items and summary state on delivery errors, retry failed announce drains, and avoid dropping unsent announcements on timeout/failure. (#16729) Thanks @Clawdette-Workspace.
- Gateway/Config: make `config.patch` merge object arrays by `id` (for example `agents.list`) instead of replacing the whole array, so partial agent updates do not silently delete unrelated agents. (#6766) Thanks @lightclient.
- Webchat/Prompts: stop injecting direct-chat `conversation_label` into inbound untrusted metadata context blocks, preventing internal label noise from leaking into visible chat replies. (#16556) Thanks @nberardi.
- Auto-reply/Prompts: include trusted inbound `message_id`, `chat_id`, `reply_to_id`, and optional `message_id_full` metadata fields so action tools (for example reactions) can target the triggering message without relying on user text. (#17662) Thanks @MaikiMolto.
- Gateway/Sessions: abort active embedded runs and clear queued session work before `sessions.reset`, returning unavailable if the run does not stop in time. (#16576) Thanks @Grynn.
- Sessions/Agents: harden transcript path resolution for mismatched agent context by preserving explicit store roots and adding safe absolute-path fallback to the correct agent sessions directory. (#16288) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents: add a safety timeout around embedded `session.compact()` to ensure stalled compaction runs settle and release blocked session lanes. (#16331) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Agents/Tools: make required-parameter validation errors list missing fields and instruct: "Supply correct parameters before retrying," reducing repeated invalid tool-call loops (for example `read({})`). (#14729)
- Agents: keep unresolved mutating tool failures visible until the same action retry succeeds, scope mutation-error surfacing to mutating calls (including `session_status` model changes), and dedupe duplicate failure warnings in outbound replies. (#16131) Thanks @Swader.
- Agents/Process/Bootstrap: preserve unbounded `process log` offset-only pagination (default tail applies only when both `offset` and `limit` are omitted) and enforce strict `bootstrapTotalMaxChars` budgeting across injected bootstrap content (including markers), skipping additional injection when remaining budget is too small. (#16539) Thanks @CharlieGreenman.
- Agents/Workspace: persist bootstrap onboarding state so partially initialized workspaces recover missing `BOOTSTRAP.md` once, while completed onboarding keeps BOOTSTRAP deleted even if runtime files are later recreated. Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Agents/Workspace: create `BOOTSTRAP.md` when core workspace files are seeded in partially initialized workspaces, while keeping BOOTSTRAP one-shot after onboarding deletion. (#16457) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents: classify external timeout aborts during compaction the same as internal timeouts, preventing unnecessary auth-profile rotation and preserving compaction-timeout snapshot fallback behavior. (#9855) Thanks @mverrilli.
- Agents: treat empty-stream provider failures (`request ended without sending any chunks`) as timeout-class failover signals, enabling auth-profile rotation/fallback and showing a friendly timeout message instead of raw provider errors. (#10210) Thanks @zenchantlive.
- Agents: treat `read` tool `file_path` arguments as valid in tool-start diagnostics to avoid false “read tool called without path” warnings when alias parameters are used. (#16717) Thanks @Stache73.
- Agents/Transcript: drop malformed tool-call blocks with blank required fields (`id`/`name` or missing `input`/`arguments`) during session transcript repair to prevent persistent tool-call corruption on future turns. (#15485) Thanks @mike-zachariades.
- Tools/Write/Edit: normalize structured text-block arguments for `content`/`oldText`/`newText` before filesystem edits, preventing JSON-like file corruption and false “exact text not found” misses from block-form params. (#16778) Thanks @danielpipernz.
- Ollama/Agents: avoid forcing `<final>` tag enforcement for Ollama models, which could suppress all output as `(no output)`. (#16191) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Plugins: suppress false duplicate plugin id warnings when the same extension is discovered via multiple paths (config/workspace/global vs bundled), while still warning on genuine duplicates. (#16222) Thanks @shadril238.
- Agents/Process: supervise PTY/child process lifecycles with explicit ownership, cancellation, timeouts, and deterministic cleanup, preventing Codex/Pi PTY sessions from dying or stalling on resume. (#14257) Thanks @onutc.
- Skills: watch `SKILL.md` only when refreshing skills snapshot to avoid file-descriptor exhaustion in large data trees. (#11325) Thanks @household-bard.
- Memory/QMD: make `memory status` read-only by skipping QMD boot update/embed side effects for status-only manager checks.
- Memory/QMD: keep original QMD failures when builtin fallback initialization fails (for example missing embedding API keys), instead of replacing them with fallback init errors.
- Memory/Builtin: keep `memory status` dirty reporting stable across invocations by deriving status-only manager dirty state from persisted index metadata instead of process-start defaults. (#10863) Thanks @BarryYangi.

- Memory/QMD: detect null-byte `ENOTDIR` update failures, rebuild managed collections once, and retry update to self-heal corrupted collection metadata. (#12919) Thanks @jorgejhms.
- Memory/QMD/Security: add `rawKeyPrefix` support for QMD scope rules and preserve legacy `keyPrefix: "agent:..."` matching, preventing scoped deny bypass when operators match agent-prefixed session keys.
- Memory/Builtin: narrow memory watcher targets to markdown globs and ignore dependency/venv directories to reduce file-descriptor pressure during memory sync startup. (#11721) Thanks @rex05ai.
- Security/Memory-LanceDB: treat recalled memories as untrusted context (escape injected memory text + explicit non-instruction framing), skip likely prompt-injection payloads during auto-capture, and restrict auto-capture to user messages to reduce memory-poisoning risk. (#12524) Thanks @davidschmid24.
- Security/Memory-LanceDB: require explicit `autoCapture: true` opt-in (default is now disabled) to prevent automatic PII capture unless operators intentionally enable it. (#12552) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.

- Security/Exec: harden PATH handling by disabling project-local `node_modules/.bin` bootstrapping by default, disallowing node-host `PATH` overrides, and spawning ACP servers via the current executable by default. Thanks @akhmittra.
- Security/Tlon: harden Urbit URL fetching against SSRF by blocking private/internal hosts by default (opt-in: `channels.tlon.allowPrivateNetwork`). Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Voice Call (Telnyx): require webhook signature verification when receiving inbound events; configs without `telnyx.publicKey` are now rejected unless `skipSignatureVerification` is enabled. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Voice Call: require valid Twilio webhook signatures even when ngrok free tier loopback compatibility mode is enabled. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Discovery: stop treating Bonjour TXT records as authoritative routing (prefer resolved service endpoints) and prevent discovery from overriding stored TLS pins; autoconnect now requires a previously trusted gateway. Thanks @simecek.

## 2026.2.13

### Changes

- Install: add optional Podman-based setup: `setup-podman.sh` for one-time host setup (openclaw user, image, launch script, systemd quadlet), `run-openclaw-podman.sh launch` / `launch setup`; systemd Quadlet unit for openclaw user service; docs for rootless container, openclaw user (subuid/subgid), and quadlet (troubleshooting). (#16273) Thanks @DarwinsBuddy.
- Discord: send voice messages with waveform previews from local audio files (including silent delivery). (#7253) Thanks @nyanjou.
- Discord: add configurable presence status/activity/type/url (custom status defaults to activity text). (#10855) Thanks @h0tp-ftw.
- Slack/Plugins: add thread-ownership outbound gating via `message_sending` hooks, including @-mention bypass tracking and Slack outbound hook wiring for cancel/modify behavior. (#15775) Thanks @DarlingtonDeveloper.
- Agents: add synthetic catalog support for `hf:zai-org/GLM-5`. (#15867) Thanks @battman21.
- Skills: remove duplicate `local-places` Google Places skill/proxy and keep `goplaces` as the single supported Google Places path.
- Agents: add pre-prompt context diagnostics (`messages`, `systemPromptChars`, `promptChars`, provider/model, session file) before embedded runner prompt calls to improve overflow debugging. (#8930) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Onboarding/Providers: add first-class Hugging Face Inference provider support (provider wiring, onboarding auth choice/API key flow, and default-model selection), and preserve Hugging Face auth intent in auth-choice remapping (`tokenProvider=huggingface` with `authChoice=apiKey`) while skipping env-override prompts when an explicit token is provided. (#13472) Thanks @Josephrp.
- Onboarding/Providers: add `minimax-api-key-cn` auth choice for the MiniMax China API endpoint. (#15191) Thanks @liuy.

### Breaking

- Config/State: removed legacy `.moltbot` auto-detection/migration and `moltbot.json` config candidates. If you still have state/config under `~/.moltbot`, move it to `~/.openclaw` (recommended) or set `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` / `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` explicitly.

### Fixes

- Gateway/Auth: add trusted-proxy mode hardening follow-ups by keeping `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_*` env compatibility, auto-normalizing invalid setup combinations in interactive `gateway configure` (trusted-proxy forces `bind=lan` and disables Tailscale serve/funnel), and suppressing shared-secret/rate-limit audit findings that do not apply to trusted-proxy deployments. (#15940) Thanks @nickytonline.
- Docs/Hooks: update hooks documentation URLs to the new `/automation/hooks` location. (#16165) Thanks @nicholascyh.
- Security/Audit: warn when `gateway.tools.allow` re-enables default-denied tools over HTTP `POST /tools/invoke`, since this can increase RCE blast radius if the gateway is reachable.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: harden npm-based installs by restricting specs to registry packages only, passing `--ignore-scripts` to `npm pack`, and cleaning up temp install directories.
- Security/Sessions: preserve inter-session input provenance for routed prompts so delegated/internal sessions are not treated as direct external user instructions. Thanks @anbecker.
- Feishu: stop persistent Typing reaction on NO_REPLY/suppressed runs by wiring reply-dispatcher cleanup to remove typing indicators. (#15464) Thanks @arosstale.
- Agents: strip leading empty lines from `sanitizeUserFacingText` output and normalize whitespace-only outputs to empty text. (#16158) Thanks @mcinteerj.
- BlueBubbles: gracefully degrade when Private API is disabled by filtering private-only actions, skipping private-only reactions/reply effects, and avoiding private reply markers so non-private flows remain usable. (#16002) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y.
- Outbound: add a write-ahead delivery queue with crash-recovery retries to prevent lost outbound messages after gateway restarts. (#15636) Thanks @nabbilkhan, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Auto-reply/Threading: auto-inject implicit reply threading so `replyToMode` works without requiring model-emitted `[[reply_to_current]]`, while preserving `replyToMode: "off"` behavior for implicit Slack replies and keeping block-streaming chunk coalescing stable under `replyToMode: "first"`. (#14976) Thanks @Diaspar4u.
- Auto-reply/Threading: honor explicit `[[reply_to_*]]` tags even when `replyToMode` is `off`. (#16174) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Plugins/Threading: rename `allowTagsWhenOff` to `allowExplicitReplyTagsWhenOff` and keep the old key as a deprecated alias for compatibility. (#16189)
- Outbound/Threading: pass `replyTo` and `threadId` from `message send` tool actions through the core outbound send path to channel adapters, preserving thread/reply routing. (#14948) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Auto-reply/Media: allow image-only inbound messages (no caption) to reach the agent instead of short-circuiting as empty text, and preserve thread context in queued/followup prompt bodies for media-only runs. (#11916) Thanks @arosstale.
- Discord: route autoThread replies to existing threads instead of the root channel. (#8302) Thanks @gavinbmoore, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Web UI: add `img` to DOMPurify allowed tags and `src`/`alt` to allowed attributes so markdown images render in webchat instead of being stripped. (#15437) Thanks @lailoo.
- Telegram/Matrix: treat MP3 and M4A (including `audio/mp4`) as voice-compatible for `asVoice` routing, and keep WAV/AAC falling back to regular audio sends. (#15438) Thanks @azade-c.
- WhatsApp: preserve outbound document filenames for web-session document sends instead of always sending `"file"`. (#15594) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Telegram: cap bot menu registration to Telegram's 100-command limit with an overflow warning while keeping typed hidden commands available. (#15844) Thanks @battman21.
- Telegram: scope skill commands to the resolved agent for default accounts so `setMyCommands` no longer triggers `BOT_COMMANDS_TOO_MUCH` when multiple agents are configured. (#15599)
- Discord: avoid misrouting numeric guild allowlist entries to `/channels/<guildId>` by prefixing guild-only inputs with `guild:` during resolution. (#12326) Thanks @headswim.
- Memory/QMD: default `memory.qmd.searchMode` to `search` for faster CPU-only recall and always scope `search`/`vsearch` requests to managed collections (auto-falling back to `query` when required). (#16047) Thanks @togotago.
- Memory/LanceDB: add configurable `captureMaxChars` for auto-capture while keeping the legacy 500-char default. (#16641) Thanks @ciberponk.
- MS Teams: preserve parsed mention entities/text when appending OneDrive fallback file links, and accept broader real-world Teams mention ID formats (`29:...`, `8:orgid:...`) while still rejecting placeholder patterns. (#15436) Thanks @hyojin.
- Media: classify `text/*` MIME types as documents in media-kind routing so text attachments are no longer treated as unknown. (#12237) Thanks @arosstale.
- Inbound/Web UI: preserve literal `\n` sequences when normalizing inbound text so Windows paths like `C:\\Work\\nxxx\\README.md` are not corrupted. (#11547) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- TUI/Streaming: preserve richer streamed assistant text when final payload drops pre-tool-call text blocks, while keeping non-empty final payload authoritative for plain-text updates. (#15452) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Providers/MiniMax: switch implicit MiniMax API-key provider from `openai-completions` to `anthropic-messages` with the correct Anthropic-compatible base URL, fixing `invalid role: developer (2013)` errors on MiniMax M2.5. (#15275) Thanks @lailoo.
- Ollama/Agents: use resolved model/provider base URLs for native `/api/chat` streaming (including aliased providers), normalize `/v1` endpoints, and forward abort + `maxTokens` stream options for reliable cancellation and token caps. (#11853) Thanks @BrokenFinger98.
- OpenAI Codex/Spark: implement end-to-end `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` support across fallback/thinking/model resolution and `models list` forward-compat visibility. (#14990, #15174) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y, @loiie45e.
- Agents/Codex: allow `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` in forward-compat fallback, live model filtering, and thinking presets, and fix model-picker recognition for spark. (#14990) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y.
- Models/Codex: resolve configured `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` through forward-compat fallback during `models list`, so it is not incorrectly tagged as missing when runtime resolution succeeds. (#15174) Thanks @loiie45e.
- OpenAI Codex/Auth: bridge OpenClaw OAuth profiles into `pi` `auth.json` so model discovery and models-list registry resolution can use Codex OAuth credentials. (#15184) Thanks @loiie45e.
- Auth/OpenAI Codex: share OAuth login handling across onboarding and `models auth login --provider openai-codex`, keep onboarding alive when OAuth fails, and surface a direct OAuth help note instead of terminating the wizard. (#15406, follow-up to #14552) Thanks @zhiluo20.
- Onboarding/Providers: add vLLM as an onboarding provider with model discovery, auth profile wiring, and non-interactive auth-choice validation. (#12577) Thanks @gejifeng.
- Onboarding/CLI: restore terminal state without resuming paused `stdin`, so onboarding exits cleanly (including Docker TTY installs that would otherwise hang). (#12972) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Signal/Install: auto-install `signal-cli` via Homebrew on non-x64 Linux architectures, avoiding x86_64 native binary `Exec format error` failures on arm64/arm hosts. (#15443) Thanks @jogvan-k.
- macOS Voice Wake: fix a crash in trigger trimming for CJK/Unicode transcripts by matching and slicing on original-string ranges instead of transformed-string indices. (#11052) Thanks @Flash-LHR.
- Mattermost (plugin): retry websocket monitor connections with exponential backoff and abort-aware teardown so transient connect failures no longer permanently stop monitoring. (#14962) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Discord/Agents: apply channel/group `historyLimit` during embedded-runner history compaction to prevent long-running channel sessions from bypassing truncation and overflowing context windows. (#11224) Thanks @shadril238.
- Outbound targets: fail closed for WhatsApp/Twitch/Google Chat fallback paths so invalid or missing targets are dropped instead of rerouted, and align resolver hints with strict target requirements. (#13578) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Gateway/Restart: clear stale command-queue and heartbeat wake runtime state after SIGUSR1 in-process restarts to prevent zombie gateway behavior where queued work stops draining. (#15195) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Heartbeat: prevent scheduler silent-death races during runner reloads, preserve retry cooldown backoff under wake bursts, and prioritize user/action wake causes over interval/retry reasons when coalescing. (#15108) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Heartbeat: allow explicit wake (`wake`) and hook wake (`hook:*`) reasons to run even when `HEARTBEAT.md` is effectively empty so queued system events are processed. (#14527) Thanks @arosstale.
- Auto-reply/Heartbeat: strip sentence-ending `HEARTBEAT_OK` tokens even when followed by up to 4 punctuation characters, while preserving surrounding sentence punctuation. (#15847) Thanks @Spacefish.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` when resolving existing transcript paths in reply runs so non-default agents and heartbeat/chat handlers no longer fail with `Session file path must be within sessions directory`. (#15141) Thanks @Goldenmonstew.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` through status and usage transcript-resolution paths (auto-reply, gateway usage APIs, and session cost/log loaders) so non-default agents can resolve absolute session files without path-validation failures. (#15103) Thanks @jalehman.
- Sessions: archive previous transcript files on `/new` and `/reset` session resets (including gateway `sessions.reset`) so stale transcripts do not accumulate on disk. (#14869) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Status/Sessions: stop clamping derived `totalTokens` to context-window size, keep prompt-token snapshots wired through session accounting, and surface context usage as unknown when fresh snapshot data is missing to avoid false 100% reports. (#15114) Thanks @echoVic.
- Gateway/Routing: speed up hot paths for session listing (derived titles + previews), WS broadcast, and binding resolution.
- Gateway/Sessions: cache derived title + last-message transcript reads to speed up repeated sessions list refreshes.
- CLI/Completion: route plugin-load logs to stderr and write generated completion scripts directly to stdout to avoid `source <(openclaw completion ...)` corruption. (#15481) Thanks @arosstale.
- CLI: lazily load outbound provider dependencies and remove forced success-path exits so commands terminate naturally without killing intentional long-running foreground actions. (#12906) Thanks @DrCrinkle.
- CLI: speed up startup by lazily registering core commands (keeps rich `--help` while reducing cold-start overhead).
- Security/Gateway + ACP: block high-risk tools (`sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) from HTTP `/tools/invoke` by default with `gateway.tools.{allow,deny}` overrides, and harden ACP permission selection to fail closed when tool identity/options are ambiguous while supporting `allow_always`/`reject_always`. (#15390) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/ACP: prompt for non-read/search permission requests in ACP clients (reduces silent tool approval risk). Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Gateway: breaking default-behavior change - canvas IP-based auth fallback now only accepts machine-scoped addresses (RFC1918, link-local, ULA IPv6, CGNAT); public-source IP matches now require bearer token auth. (#14661) Thanks @sumleo.
- Security/Link understanding: block loopback/internal host patterns and private/mapped IPv6 addresses in extracted URL handling to close SSRF bypasses in link CLI flows. (#15604) Thanks @AI-Reviewer-QS.
- Security/Browser: constrain `POST /trace/stop`, `POST /wait/download`, and `POST /download` output paths to OpenClaw temp roots and reject traversal/escape paths.
- Security/Browser: sanitize download `suggestedFilename` to keep implicit `wait/download` paths within the downloads root. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Browser: confine `POST /hooks/file-chooser` upload paths to an OpenClaw temp uploads root and reject traversal/escape paths. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Browser: require auth for the sandbox browser bridge server (protects `/profiles`, `/tabs`, CDP URLs, and other control endpoints). Thanks @jackhax.
- Security: bind local helper servers to loopback and fail closed on non-loopback OAuth callback hosts (reduces localhost/LAN attack surface).

- Security/WhatsApp: enforce `0o600` on `creds.json` and `creds.json.bak` on save/backup/restore paths to reduce credential file exposure. (#10529) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/Gateway: sanitize and truncate untrusted WebSocket header values in pre-handshake close logs to reduce log-poisoning risk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Audit: add misconfiguration checks for sandbox Docker config with sandbox mode off, ineffective `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` entries, global minimal tool-profile overrides by agent profiles, and permissive extension-plugin tool reachability.
- Security/Audit: distinguish external webhooks (`hooks.enabled`) from internal hooks (`hooks.internal.enabled`) in attack-surface summaries to avoid false exposure signals when only internal hooks are enabled. (#13474) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Security/Onboarding: clarify multi-user DM isolation remediation with explicit `openclaw config set session.dmScope ...` commands in security audit, doctor security, and channel onboarding guidance. (#13129) Thanks @VintLin.
- Security/Gateway: bind node `system.run` approval overrides to gateway exec-approval records (runId-bound), preventing approval-bypass via `node.invoke` param injection. Thanks @222n5.
- Agents/Nodes: harden node exec approval decision handling in the `nodes` tool run path by failing closed on unexpected approval decisions, and add regression coverage for approval-required retry/deny/timeout flows. (#4726) Thanks @rmorse.
- Android/Nodes: harden `app.update` by requiring HTTPS and gateway-host URL matching plus SHA-256 verification, stream URL camera downloads to disk with size guards to avoid memory spikes, and stop signing release builds with debug keys. (#13541) Thanks @smartprogrammer93.
- Routing: enforce strict binding-scope matching across peer/guild/team/roles so peer-scoped Discord/Slack bindings no longer match unrelated guild/team contexts or fallback tiers. (#15274) Thanks @lailoo.
- Exec/Allowlist: allow multiline heredoc bodies (`<<`, `<<-`) while keeping multiline non-heredoc shell commands blocked, so exec approval parsing permits heredoc input safely without allowing general newline command chaining. (#13811) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Config: preserve `${VAR}` env references when writing config files so `openclaw config set/apply/patch` does not persist secrets to disk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Config: remove a cross-request env-snapshot race in config writes by carrying read-time env context into write calls per request, preserving `${VAR}` refs safely under concurrent gateway config mutations. (#11560) Thanks @akoscz.
- Config: log overwrite audit entries (path, backup target, and hash transition) whenever an existing config file is replaced, improving traceability for unexpected config clobbers.
- Config: keep legacy audio transcription migration strict by rejecting non-string/unsafe command tokens while still migrating valid custom script executables. (#5042) Thanks @shayan919293.
- Config: accept `$schema` key in config file so JSON Schema editor tooling works without validation errors. (#14998)
- Gateway/Tools Invoke: sanitize `/tools/invoke` execution failures while preserving `400` for tool input errors and returning `500` for unexpected runtime failures, with regression coverage and docs updates. (#13185) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Gateway/Hooks: preserve `408` for hook request-body timeout responses while keeping bounded auth-failure cache eviction behavior, with timeout-status regression coverage. (#15848) Thanks @AI-Reviewer-QS.
- Plugins/Hooks: fire `before_tool_call` hook exactly once per tool invocation in embedded runs by removing duplicate dispatch paths while preserving parameter mutation semantics. (#15635) Thanks @lailoo.
- Agents/Transcript policy: sanitize OpenAI/Codex tool-call ids during transcript policy normalization to prevent invalid tool-call identifiers from propagating into session history. (#15279) Thanks @divisonofficer.
- Agents/Image tool: cap image-analysis completion `maxTokens` by model capability (`min(4096, model.maxTokens)`) to avoid over-limit provider failures while still preventing truncation. (#11770) Thanks @detecti1.
- Agents/Compaction: centralize exec default resolution in the shared tool factory so per-agent `tools.exec` overrides (host/security/ask/node and related defaults) persist across compaction retries. (#15833) Thanks @napetrov.
- Gateway/Agents: stop injecting a phantom `main` agent into gateway agent listings when `agents.list` explicitly excludes it. (#11450) Thanks @arosstale.
- Process/Exec: avoid shell execution for `.exe` commands on Windows so env overrides work reliably in `runCommandWithTimeout`. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.

- Security/Pairing: generate 256-bit base64url device and node pairing tokens and use byte-safe constant-time verification to avoid token-compare edge-case failures. (#16535) Thanks @FaizanKolega, @gumadeiras.

## 2026.2.12

### Changes

- CLI/Plugins: add `openclaw plugins uninstall <id>` with `--dry-run`, `--force`, and `--keep-files` options, including safe uninstall path handling and plugin uninstall docs. (#5985) Thanks @JustasMonkev.
- CLI: add `openclaw logs --local-time` to display log timestamps in local timezone. (#13818) Thanks @xialonglee.
- Telegram: render blockquotes as native `<blockquote>` tags instead of stripping them. (#14608)
- Telegram: expose `/compact` in the native command menu. (#10352) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Discord: add role-based allowlists and role-based agent routing. (#10650) Thanks @Minidoracat.
- Config: avoid redacting `maxTokens`-like fields during config snapshot redaction, preventing round-trip validation failures in `/config`. (#14006) Thanks @constansino.

### Breaking

- Hooks: `POST /hooks/agent` now rejects payload `sessionKey` overrides by default. To keep fixed hook context, set `hooks.defaultSessionKey` (recommended with `hooks.allowedSessionKeyPrefixes: ["hook:"]`). If you need legacy behavior, explicitly set `hooks.allowRequestSessionKey: true`. Thanks @alpernae for reporting.

### Fixes

- Gateway/OpenResponses: harden URL-based `input_file`/`input_image` handling with explicit SSRF deny policy, hostname allowlists (`files.urlAllowlist` / `images.urlAllowlist`), per-request URL input caps (`maxUrlParts`), blocked-fetch audit logging, and regression coverage/docs updates.

- Security/Web tools: treat browser/web content as untrusted by default (wrapped outputs for browser snapshot/tabs/console and structured external-content metadata for web tools), and strip `toolResult.details` from model-facing transcript/compaction inputs to reduce prompt-injection replay risk.
- Security/Hooks: harden webhook and device token verification with shared constant-time secret comparison, and add per-client auth-failure throttling for hook endpoints (`429` + `Retry-After`). Thanks @akhmittra.
- Security/Browser: require auth for loopback browser control HTTP routes, auto-generate `gateway.auth.token` when browser control starts without auth, and add a security-audit check for unauthenticated browser control. Thanks @tcusolle.

- Auth: read Codex CLI keychain tokens on macOS before falling back to `~/.codex/auth.json`, preventing stale refresh tokens from breaking gateway live tests.
- Security/Exec approvals: reject shell command substitution (`$()` and backticks) inside double quotes to prevent exec allowlist bypass when exec allowlist mode is explicitly enabled (the default configuration does not use this mode). Thanks @simecek.

This allows long-running agents to operate autonomously without manual re-authentication (#654 — thanks @radek-paclt).

## 2026.1.8

### Highlights

- Security: DMs locked down by default across providers; pairing-first + allowlist guidance.
- Sandbox: per-agent scope defaults + workspace access controls; tool/session isolation tuned.
- Agent loop: compaction, pruning, streaming, and error handling hardened.
- Providers: Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack reliability, threading, reactions, media, and retries improved.
- Control UI: logs tab, streaming stability, focus mode, and large-output rendering fixes.
- CLI/Gateway/Doctor: daemon/logs/status, auth migration, and diagnostics significantly expanded.

### Breaking

- **SECURITY (update ASAP):** inbound DMs are now **locked down by default** on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Discord/Slack.
  - Previously, if you didn’t configure an allowlist, your bot could be **open to anyone** (especially discoverable Telegram bots).
  - New default: DM pairing (`dmPolicy="pairing"` / `discord.dm.policy="pairing"` / `slack.dm.policy="pairing"`).
  - To keep old “open to everyone” behavior: set `dmPolicy="open"` and include `"*"` in the relevant `allowFrom` (Discord/Slack: `discord.dm.allowFrom` / `slack.dm.allowFrom`).
  - Approve requests via `openclaw pairing list <provider>` + `openclaw pairing approve <provider> <code>`.
- Sandbox: default `agent.sandbox.scope` to `"agent"` (one container/workspace per agent). Use `"session"` for per-session isolation; `"shared"` disables cross-session isolation.
- Timestamps in agent envelopes are now UTC (compact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`); removed `messages.timestampPrefix`. Add `agent.userTimezone` to tell the model the user’s local time (system prompt only).
- Model config schema changes (auth profiles + model lists); doctor auto-migrates and the gateway rewrites legacy configs on startup.
- Commands: gate all slash commands to authorized senders; add `/compact` to manually compact session context.
- Groups: `whatsapp.groups`, `telegram.groups`, and `imessage.groups` now act as allowlists when set. Add `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior.
- Auto-reply: removed `autoReply` from Discord/Slack/Telegram channel configs; use `requireMention` instead (Telegram topics now support `requireMention` overrides).
- CLI: remove `update`, `gateway-daemon`, `gateway {install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|daemon status|wake|send|agent}`, and `telegram` commands; move `login/logout` to `providers login/logout` (top-level aliases hidden); use `daemon` for service control, `send`/`agent`/`wake` for RPC, and `nodes canvas` for canvas ops.

### Fixes

- **CLI/Gateway/Doctor:** daemon runtime selection + improved logs/status/health/errors; auth/password handling for local CLI; richer close/timeout details; auto-migrate legacy config/sessions/state; integrity checks + repair prompts; `--yes`/`--non-interactive`; `--deep` gateway scans; better restart/service hints.
- **Agent loop + compaction:** compaction/pruning tuning, overflow handling, safer bootstrap context, and per-provider threading/confirmations; opt-in tool-result pruning + compact tracking.
- **Sandbox + tools:** per-agent sandbox overrides, workspaceAccess controls, session tool visibility, tool policy overrides, process isolation, and tool schema/timeout/reaction unification.
- **Providers (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack/Signal/iMessage):** retry/backoff, threading, reactions, media groups/attachments, mention gating, typing behavior, and error/log stability; long polling + forum topic isolation for Telegram.
- **Gateway/CLI UX:** `openclaw logs`, cron list colors/aliases, docs search, agents list/add/delete flows, status usage snapshots, runtime/auth source display, and `/status`/commands auth unification.
- **Control UI/Web:** logs tab, focus mode polish, config form resilience, streaming stability, tool output caps, windowed chat history, and reconnect/password URL auth.
- **macOS/Android/TUI/Build:** macOS gateway races, QR bundling, JSON5 config safety, Voice Wake hardening; Android EXIF rotation + APK naming/versioning; TUI key handling; tooling/bundling fixes.
- **Packaging/compat:** npm dist folder coverage, Node 25 qrcode-terminal import fixes, Bun/Playwright/WebSocket patches, and Docker Bun install.
- **Docs:** new FAQ/ClawHub/config examples/showcase entries and clarified auth, sandbox, and systemd docs.

### Maintenance

- Skills additions (Himalaya email, CodexBar, 1Password).
- Dependency refreshes (pi-\* stack, Slack SDK, discord-api-types, file-type, zod, Biome, Vite).

## 2026.1.5

### Highlights

- Models: add image-specific model config (`agent.imageModel` + fallbacks) and scan support.
- Agent tools: new `image` tool routed to the image model (when configured).
- Config: default model shorthands (`opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt`, `gpt-mini`, `gemini`, `gemini-flash`).
- Docs: document built-in model shorthands + precedence (user config wins).
- Bun: optional local install/build workflow without maintaining a Bun lockfile (see `docs/bun.md`).

### Fixes

- Control UI: render Markdown in tool result cards.
- Control UI: prevent overlapping action buttons in Discord guild rules on narrow layouts.
- Android: tapping the foreground service notification brings the app to the front. (#179) — thanks @Syhids

- CLI: use tailnet IP for local gateway calls when bind is tailnet/auto (fixes #176).
- Env: load global `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/.env` (`~/.openclaw/.env`) as a fallback after CWD `.env`.
- Env: optional login-shell env fallback (opt-in; imports expected keys without overriding existing env).
- Agent tools: OpenAI-compatible tool JSON Schemas (fix `browser`, normalize union schemas).
- Onboarding: when running from source, auto-build missing Control UI assets (`bun run ui:build`).
- Discord/Slack: route reaction + system notifications to the correct session (no main-session bleed).
- Agent tools: honor `agent.tools` allow/deny policy even when sandbox is off.
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when OpenAI emits repeated `message_end` events.
- Commands: unify /status (inline) and command auth across providers; group bypass for authorized control commands; remove Discord /clawd slash handler.
- CLI: run `openclaw agent` via the Gateway by default; use `--local` to force embedded mode.
